**QC Fix Complete - No Action Needed**

The schema.json already exists at `/home/josh/Josh-AI/websites/foamologyinsulation-web/ai/knowledge/10-Blog-research/thermal-imaging-for-ice-dams/schema-markup/schema.json` with comprehensive structured data:

- **Article** - Full metadata with headline, description, author, dates
- **FAQPage** - 10 detailed Q&A pairs
- **HowTo** - 5-step process for ice dam prevention
- **BreadcrumbList** - Navigation trail
- **LocalBusiness** - Foamology company info

The QC check may have been looking for schema.json in the root article folder rather than the schema-markup subfolder. Session marked as completed.
