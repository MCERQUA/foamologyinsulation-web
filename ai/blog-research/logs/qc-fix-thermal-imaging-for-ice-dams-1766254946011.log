- **FAQPage schema** with 10 Q&A pairs optimized for featured snippets
- **HowTo schema** with 5 step-by-step instructions

`/home/josh/Josh-AI/websites/foamologyinsulation-web/ai/knowledge/10-Blog-research/thermal-imaging-for-ice-dams/schema-markup/schema.json`

**Task Complete** - The schema.json file exists and contains proper structured data including Article, FAQPage, HowTo, BreadcrumbList, and LocalBusiness schemas (214 lines, 11.6KB).
