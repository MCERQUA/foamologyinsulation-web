## Image Usage Guidelines

### For Blog Posts
1. Use images that directly relate to the topic
2. Thermal images are excellent for ice dam and heat loss articles
3. Problem pictures work great for "why you need proper insulation" content
4. Before/after pairs (Connex, Quonset) are powerful

### For Service Pages
- **Spray Foam Service**: Use spray foam job photos
- **Crawlspace Service**: Use crawlspace + removal photos
- **Thermal Inspection**: Use thermal pictures
- **Insulation Removal**: Use removal photos

### For Social Media
- Team photos (`Fabio SPraying.jpg`, `We LOVE FOAM.jpg`)
- Dramatic before/after (Quonset hut, Connex)
- Problem photos with educational captions

### Image Paths
All images are in: `public/gallery/[FOLDER]/[FILENAME]`

Example usage in MDX:
```jsx
<ImageWithCaption
  src="/gallery/Thermal Pictures/Cold Spot Thermal.jpg"
  alt="Thermal image showing cold spot indicating heat loss"
  caption="Thermal imaging reveals hidden heat loss in this Alaska home"
/>
```
