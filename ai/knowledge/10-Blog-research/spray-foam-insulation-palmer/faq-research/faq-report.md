### FAQ #1: Is spray foam insulation worth it in Alaska?

**Why Include:** Top decision-making question, featured snippet opportunity, addresses cost objection

**Recommended Answer (58 words):**
Yes, spray foam insulation is worth it in Alaska's extreme climate. It provides superior energy savings (15-40% reduction in heating costs), prevents ice dams, lasts 80-100 years, and acts as both insulation and vapor barrier. While upfront costs are higher than fiberglass, most Alaska homeowners see payback in 5-10 years through energy savings alone.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Featured snippet + direct user conversion

---

### FAQ #2: How long does spray foam insulation last in Alaska?

**Why Include:** Longevity justifies premium cost, strong featured snippet opportunity

**Recommended Answer (52 words):**
Spray foam insulation lasts 80-100 years in Alaska when properly installed. Closed-cell spray foam offers superior longevity over open-cell due to its rigid structure and moisture resistance. Unlike fiberglass or cellulose that can settle, sag, or deteriorate over time, spray foam maintains its structure and effectiveness for the lifetime of your home.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Featured snippet for "how long does spray foam last"

---

### FAQ #3: Which is better for Alaska: open cell or closed cell spray foam?

**Why Include:** Critical product selection question, clear recommendation needed

**Recommended Answer (61 words):**
Closed-cell spray foam is better for Alaska's extreme climate. It provides R-7 per inch (vs. R-3.8 for open-cell), acts as a vapor barrier to prevent moisture problems, and adds structural strength. Open-cell foam lacks the moisture barrier properties needed for Alaska's temperature extremes and requires additional vapor barriers. For Palmer's harsh winters, closed-cell is the recommended choice.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Featured snippet + product decision support

---

### FAQ #4: How much does spray foam insulation cost in Alaska?

**Why Include:** #1 information query, removes price barrier early

**Recommended Answer (63 words):**
Spray foam insulation in Alaska costs $2,200-$5,500 for 1,000 square feet with 3 inches of insulation. Closed-cell foam costs $1.20-$1.80 per board foot, while open-cell costs $0.70-$1.10 per board foot. Total project costs vary based on home size, foam type, and accessibility. Most Palmer homeowners invest $8,000-$20,000 for whole-home insulation, with payback in 5-10 years.

**Format:** Paragraph with price ranges
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Commercial investigation searches

---

### FAQ #5: Does spray foam prevent ice dams in Alaska?

**Why Include:** Major Alaska pain point, problem-solution content

**Recommended Answer (57 words):**
Yes, spray foam insulation prevents ice dams by sealing your attic and stopping heat loss. Ice dams form when heat escapes through the roof, melting snow that refreezes at the eaves. Spray foam creates an airtight barrier that keeps attics cold, preventing the melt-refreeze cycle. This protects Palmer homes from thousands in ice dam damage each winter.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Problem-aware audience, featured snippet

---

### FAQ #6: What R-value is recommended for Alaska homes?

**Why Include:** Technical planning information, list snippet opportunity

**Recommended Answer (54 words):**
Alaska homes should have:
- Attics: R-49 to R-60
- Walls: R-21 to R-30
- Floors: R-25 to R-30
- Crawlspaces: R-25 minimum

Palmer is in Climate Zone 7, requiring high R-values for extreme cold. Closed-cell spray foam achieves R-49 in just 7 inches, compared to 15+ inches for fiberglass.

**Format:** List
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Planning/research phase users

---

### FAQ #7: Can homeowners install spray foam themselves?

**Why Include:** Common question, opportunity to emphasize professional value

**Recommended Answer (51 words):**
No, spray foam installation requires professional equipment and expertise. The process uses specialized plural-component pumps, heated hoses, high-pressure mixing guns, and precise application techniques. Improper installation can lead to inadequate coverage, off-ratio mixing, and ventilation issues. Professional installers ensure proper R-values, vapor barriers, and building code compliance for Alaska's demanding climate.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** DIY-curious users, conversion to professional service

---

### FAQ #8: Is spray foam insulation safe after it cures?

**Why Include:** Addresses health/safety objection

**Recommended Answer (46 words):**
Yes, spray foam is completely safe once fully cured (24-48 hours). The cured foam is non-toxic, doesn't emit harmful fumes, and is inert. Proper ventilation is required during installation, but after curing, spray foam is safe for homes, schools, and commercial buildings throughout Alaska.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Safety-concerned homeowners

---

### FAQ #9: How thick should spray foam be in Alaska?

**Why Include:** Practical planning information

**Recommended Answer (58 words):**
Recommended spray foam thickness in Alaska:
- Attic: 7-9 inches (closed-cell) for R-49 to R-63
- Exterior walls: 3-4 inches for R-21 to R-28
- Crawlspace: 3-4 inches minimum
- Rim joists: 2-3 inches

Palmer's Climate Zone 7 requires substantial insulation. Closed-cell spray foam achieves higher R-values in less space than traditional insulation.

**Format:** List
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Planning phase users

---

### FAQ #10: Does closed cell spray foam act as a vapor barrier?

**Why Include:** Critical technical question for Alaska climate

**Recommended Answer (48 words):**
Yes, closed-cell spray foam acts as both insulation and vapor barrier when applied at 2+ inches thick. This dual function is ideal for Alaska's extreme temperature differences, preventing moisture condensation inside wall cavities. Open-cell foam does NOT provide vapor barrier properties and requires separate vapor barrier installation in Alaska.

**Format:** Paragraph
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Technical/specification users

---

### FAQ #11: How much can I save on energy bills with spray foam?

**Why Include:** ROI justification, supports purchase decision

**Recommended Answer (54 words):**
Alaska homeowners typically save 15-40% on heating costs with spray foam insulation. For Palmer homes spending $3,000-$5,000 annually on heating, this equals $450-$2,000 in yearly savings. Up to 40% of home heat loss comes from air leaks, which spray foam eliminates. Most homeowners see complete payback in 5-10 years.

**Format:** Paragraph with specific numbers
**Schema:** Yes
**Target:** Cost-conscious decision makers
