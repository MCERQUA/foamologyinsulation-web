## Notes & Warnings

### Source Reliability Notes

1. **Commercial vs. Government Sources**
   - Priority given to government (.gov) and research institutions over commercial sites
   - One commercial source (Xtreme Alaska) included for Alaska-specific terminology but should be paired with government citations for credibility

2. **Building Code Updates**
   - IECC codes are updated every 3 years; verify current Alaska adoption status
   - Mat-Su Borough may have local amendments to state codes
   - Always recommend readers confirm code requirements with local building department

3. **Rebate Program Changes**
   - Federal rebate programs ($74.6M allocation) are time-limited
   - Programs may have funding caps and first-come-first-served limitations
   - Recommend readers check current availability at AHFC website

4. **Research Date Sensitivity**
   - Building science research evolves; newer studies may supersede older recommendations
   - CCHRC and Building Science Corporation regularly update guidance
   - When citing research, note publication dates in article

### Contradictory Information Found

1. **R-Value Per Inch Ranges**
   - Sources cite spray foam R-values ranging from R-5.5 to R-7 per inch
   - Resolution: Use "approximately R-6 to R-7" with DOE as primary citation
   - Note: Actual R-value depends on specific foam formulation and proper installation

2. **Climate Zone Boundaries**
   - Some sources list different boroughs in Zone 8
   - Resolution: Use IECC official compliance guide as authoritative source
   - Confirmed: Palmer/Mat-Su is definitively in Climate Zone 7

3. **Vapor Barrier Requirements**
   - Some sources emphasize vapor barriers; others note foam serves dual purpose
   - Resolution: Closed-cell foam ≥1.5" acts as Class II vapor retarder in zones 6+
   - Reference Building Science Corporation for technical accuracy

### Licensing Considerations

- **Government Sources**: Public domain, no permission required
- **Research Institutions**: Standard academic citation permitted
- **Industry Organizations**: Standard citation permitted for educational/informational use
- **Commercial Sources**: One source is commercial contractor; standard web citation acceptable
- **No known copyright restrictions** for factual references and standard web linking
