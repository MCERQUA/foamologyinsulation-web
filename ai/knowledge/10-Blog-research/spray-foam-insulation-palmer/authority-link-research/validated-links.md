## Recommendation Summary

**Strong Foundation:** 12 working authority links provide excellent SEO value with mix of government (.gov), research institutions, industry organizations, and Alaska-specific sources.

**Quick Wins:**
- Use DOE, AHFC blog, SPFA, and Building Science as primary authority sources
