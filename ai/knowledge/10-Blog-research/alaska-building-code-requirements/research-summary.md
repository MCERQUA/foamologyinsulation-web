## Key Findings

### Topic Overview
Alaska has unique building code requirements due to extreme climate conditions. While no mandatory statewide energy code exists, AHFC's Building Energy Efficiency Standards (BEES) based on 2018 IECC governs approximately 68% of new residential construction. Alaska is classified into Climate Zones 6, 7, 8, and 9 (BEES-specific), with Zone 7 covering most of the state.

### Primary Keywords
- insulation Alaska (primary)
- Alaska building code
- Alaska R-value requirements
- BEES Alaska
- Alaska climate zone 7/8
- spray foam insulation Alaska

### Authority Sources
- Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) - Primary authority
- U.S. Department of Energy Building Energy Codes Program
- Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC)
- University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension
- UpCodes Alaska Building Codes

### Key R-Value Requirements
| Component | Zones 7 & 8 |
|-----------|-------------|
| Ceiling/Attic | R-49 |
| Wood Frame Walls | R-20+5 or R-13+10 |
| Mass Walls | R-19 |
| Floors | R-38 |
| Basement/Crawl Space Walls | R-15/19 |
| Slab Edge | R-10, 4 ft depth |

### Common Questions
1. What R-value insulation do I need in Alaska? (R-49 attic, R-20+5 walls)
2. Does Alaska have a mandatory statewide building code? (No, but BEES for AHFC)
3. Do I need a vapor barrier? (Yes, 6 mil poly on warm side)
4. Is spray foam worth it? (Yes, 15-35% energy savings)
5. What is BEES? (Building Energy Efficiency Standards)
