# Topic Research: Alaska Building Code Requirements

## Executive Summary

Alaska has unique building code requirements due to its extreme climate conditions. While Alaska does not have a mandatory statewide energy code for all construction, buildings financed through the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) must meet the Building Energy Efficiency Standards (BEES) based on the 2018 IECC with Alaska-specific amendments.

## 1. Alaska Energy Code Overview

### Current Code Status
- **No mandatory statewide energy code** for all residential construction
- **BEES Requirements**: Mandatory for AHFC-financed buildings since January 1, 1992
- **Current Standard**: 2018 IECC with Alaska-specific amendments (effective January 1, 2019)
- **Market Impact**: AHFC finances ~20% of market share; ~68% of new residential construction adheres to BEES

### Building Energy Efficiency Standards (BEES)
- Based on 2018 IECC and ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010 (Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality)
- Requires minimum 5 Star energy rating
- Compliance verified through PUR-101 and PUR-102 forms
- Local jurisdictions can adopt standards that meet or exceed BEES

## 2. Alaska Climate Zones

### IECC Climate Zone Classification
Alaska falls into the coldest climate zones:

| Climate Zone | Areas Covered |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Zone 7** | Most of Alaska (default) |
| **Zone 8** | Bethel, Northwest Arctic, Dellingham, Southeast Fairbanks, Fairbanks N. Star, Wade Hampton, Nome, Yukon-Koyukuk, North Slope |
| **Zone 6** | Certain southern and coastal census areas (reclassified in 2018) |
| **Zone 9** | North Slope Borough (BEES-specific, unique requirements) |

## 3. Insulation R-Value Requirements

### Ceiling/Attic Insulation
- **Zones 6, 7, 8**: R-49 minimum requirement

### Wall Insulation
| Wall Type | Zone 6 | Zones 7 & 8 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Mass Walls | R-15 | R-19 |
| Frame Walls | Varies by method | Varies by method |

### Floor Insulation
| Location | Zones 4-6 | Zones 7 & 8 |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Over Unconditioned Space | R-30 | R-38 |

### Foundation/Slab Insulation
- **Slab-on-grade floors**: Not recommended for living areas without insulation
- **Minimum recommendation**: 2 inches rigid foam plastic insulation under entire floor
- **Perimeter insulation alone**: NOT adequate for Alaska
- **Heated slabs**: Add R-5 to required slab edge R-values
- **Fairbanks (2010)**: R-15 foundation insulation required (≈3" rigid foam board)

### Special Considerations
- Ground temperatures in Alaska are near 33°F
- Permafrost areas require engineering analysis for insulation in contact with ground
- First R-value = continuous insulation, second = framing cavity insulation (either meets requirement)
- **Exterior doors**: Not more than one exterior door in Region 1 or 2 may have R-value less than R-7

## 4. Vapor Barrier Requirements

### Standard Requirements
- **Material**: 6 mil polyethylene sheeting minimum (0.06 perm rating)
- **Location**: Install on heated side of insulation
- **2/3 Rule**: Not less than 2/3 of total wall R-value must be on cold side of vapor retarder

### Installation Standards
- All seams lapped minimum one stud or joist bay, OR sealed with approved tape/sealant
- All voids between joists and studs must be insulated and sealed
- All openings (plumbing, electrical, chimneys) must be carefully sealed

### Crawl Space Requirements
- Minimum 6 mil ground vapor retarder required
- Joints overlapped 6 inches OR sealed/taped
- Edges extend to concrete footing and secured

### Vapor Retarder Classification (per Alaska Building Code 2021)
- Class I or II vapor retarders required in Climate Zones 5, 6, 7, 8 and Marine 4
- Class II vapor retarder with foam plastic insulating sheathing must comply with Table 1404.3(4)

### Alternative Approach: Arctic Wall System
- Developed by Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC)
- No plastic vapor retarder used
- Allows bidirectional drying: inside in summer, outside in winter
- Addresses known weak spot in conventional cold climate construction

## 5. Spray Foam Insulation in Alaska

### Benefits for Alaska Climate
- Prevents heat loss and maintains stable indoor temperatures in subzero conditions
- Lasts lifetime of building without sagging, settling, or deteriorating
- Addresses up to 40% energy loss from air leakage through holes, cracks, and unsealed gaps

### Permafrost Protection Applications
- 12 inches of spray foam used in raft foundations to prevent heat transfer to soil
- Temperature monitoring shows ground temperatures remained steady or rose <5°F over 2-year studies
- Effective at preventing large amounts of heat from leaking into soil

### Installation Considerations
- Requires skilled installation
- Errors can result in drastic drop in energy efficiency
- CCHRC has used SPF in affordable demonstration homes since 2009

### Attic/Roof Considerations
- Conventional warm climate insulation rules DON'T apply to Alaska
- Ventilated attic assemblies generally best for typical Alaskan winter
- Exception: Fairbanks area ice fog conditions (fog accumulates, melts, refreezes at eaves causing ice damming)

## 8. Unique Alaska Considerations

### Permafrost Construction
- Engineering analysis required for insulation in contact with ground in permafrost areas
- Heat transfer from buildings can destabilize permafrost
- Specialized foundation designs (elevated, raft foundations) often required

### Extreme Temperature Differential
- Interior temperatures often 70°F+, exterior can be -40°F or colder
- Temperature differentials of 100°F+ create extreme vapor drive
- More stringent air sealing and vapor control required

### Regional Variations
- Coastal areas: Milder temperatures, higher humidity concerns
- Interior Alaska: Extreme cold, permafrost, ice fog issues
- Northern regions: Most extreme conditions, Zone 8/9 requirements

### Energy Costs
- Alaska has some of the highest energy costs in the U.S.
- Proper insulation directly impacts heating costs and comfort
- Energy efficiency is critical for long-term affordability
