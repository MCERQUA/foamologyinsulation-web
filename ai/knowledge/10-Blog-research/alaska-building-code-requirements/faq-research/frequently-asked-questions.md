## R-Value Requirements FAQs

### Q: What R-value insulation do I need for my attic in Alaska?
**A:** Alaska homes require significant attic insulation due to extreme climate conditions:
- **Uninsulated attic**: R-60 recommended
- **Existing insulation (3-4 inches)**: R-49 recommended
- **Code minimum (Zones 7 & 8)**: R-49

This is among the highest in the nation due to Alaska's climate zones 7 and 8 classification.

### Q: What R-value is required for walls in Alaska?
**A:** Alaska wall insulation requirements for Zones 7 & 8:
- **Wood frame walls**: R-20 + R-5 continuous OR R-13 + R-10 continuous
- **Mass walls**: R-19 (Zone 7 & 8)
- **Practical options**: R-19 fiberglass in 2x6 wall, or R-13 + R-5 rigid foam overlay

### Q: What R-value is needed for floors in Alaska?
**A:** Floor insulation requirements:
- **Over unconditioned space (Zones 7 & 8)**: R-38 minimum
- **Recommended range**: R-25 to R-30 for crawlspaces
- **Important**: Perimeter-only insulation is NOT adequate for Alaska; full floor insulation required

### Q: What about basement and crawl space wall insulation?
**A:** Requirements for below-grade spaces:
- **Basement walls**: R-15 to R-19
- **Crawl space walls**: R-15 to R-19
- **Slab edge**: R-10, extending 4 feet
- **Heated slabs**: Add R-5 to required slab edge values

## Building Code FAQs

### Q: Does Alaska have a statewide building code?
**A:** Alaska has no mandatory statewide energy code for all construction. However:
- **AHFC-financed homes**: Must meet Building Energy Efficiency Standards (BEES)
- **BEES basis**: 2018 IECC with Alaska-specific amendments
- **Effective date**: January 1, 2019 for current standards
- **Market impact**: ~68% of new residential construction adheres to BEES standards

### Q: What is BEES?
**A:** BEES stands for **Building Energy Efficiency Standards**, developed by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation:
- First introduced in 1985
- Became effective January 1, 1992
- Requires minimum 5-star energy rating
- Based on 2018 IECC with Alaska amendments
- Required for any AHFC-financed construction

### Q: What climate zone is my Alaska location in?
**A:** Alaska is divided into three primary climate zones:
- **Zone 7**: Most of Alaska (default classification)
- **Zone 8**: Bethel, Northwest Arctic, Dillingham, Southeast Fairbanks, Fairbanks N. Star, Wade Hampton, Nome, Yukon-Koyukuk, North Slope boroughs
- **Zone 6**: Certain southern and coastal census areas (reclassified in 2018)
- **Zone 9**: North Slope Borough only (BEES-specific)

### Q: Do I need a building permit for insulation work?
**A:** Permit requirements vary by municipality:
- **Major renovations**: Usually require permits
- **New construction**: Always require permits
- **Minor upgrades**: Check with local building department
- **AHFC financing**: Additional documentation required (PUR-101, PUR-102 forms)

Building permits are administered at the local level, not state level.

## Vapor Barrier FAQs

### Q: Do I need a vapor barrier in Alaska?
**A:** Yes, vapor barriers are critical in Alaska construction:
- **Requirement**: 6 mil polyethylene (0.06 perm rating minimum)
- **Placement**: On the heated side (warm side) of insulation
- **2/3 Rule**: Not less than 2/3 of total wall R-value must be on cold side of vapor retarder
- **Sealing**: All seams must be lapped or sealed with approved tape

### Q: Where should the vapor barrier be placed?
**A:** In Alaska's cold climate:
- **Walls**: Interior side of insulation (warm side)
- **Ceilings**: Interior side, below insulation
- **Crawl spaces**: 6 mil minimum on ground surface
- **Slab-on-grade**: Under concrete to prevent moisture/radon intrusion
- **Joints**: Overlap minimum 6 inches, sealed or taped

### Q: Why is the vapor barrier so important in Alaska?
**A:** Extreme temperature differentials create severe vapor drive:
- Interior may be 70°F+ while exterior is -40°F
- Temperature differentials of 100°F+ create extreme moisture migration
- Condensation within walls causes rot, mold, and insulation failure
- Proper vapor control prevents structural damage and maintains R-value

## Spray Foam Insulation FAQs

### Q: Is spray foam insulation good for Alaska homes?
**A:** Spray foam is excellent for Alaska conditions:
- **Air sealing**: Eliminates up to 40% of energy loss from air leakage
- **High R-value**: Closed-cell provides R-6+ per inch
- **Moisture barrier**: Closed-cell acts as vapor barrier
- **Longevity**: Can last 80-100 years with proper installation
- **Temperature stability**: Maintains performance in subzero conditions

### Q: What's the difference between open-cell and closed-cell spray foam?
**A:** Key differences for Alaska applications:

| Feature | Open-Cell | Closed-Cell |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| R-value per inch | R-3.5 to R-3.8 | R-6.0+ |
| Vapor permeability | Allows some vapor transfer | Acts as vapor barrier |
| Density | Lower, softer | Higher, rigid |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Best application | Interior walls, attics | Exterior applications, basements, crawlspaces |

### Q: How much does spray foam insulation cost in Alaska?
**A:** Typical installed prices in Alaska:
- **Open-cell**: $1.20 - $1.80 per square foot (installed)
- **Closed-cell**: $1.80 - $2.50 per square foot (installed)
- **1,000 sq ft attic (3" depth)**: $2,200 - $5,500
- **Energy savings**: 15-35% reduction in heating bills typical

### Q: Can spray foam be used in permafrost areas?
**A:** Yes, with proper engineering:
- Used successfully in raft foundations in rural Alaska
- 12 inches of SPF can prevent heat transfer to permafrost
- Engineering analysis required for ground-contact applications
- Helps stabilize permafrost by preventing heat leakage

- **Spray foam projects**: 15-35% heating cost reduction typical
- **Air leakage**: Up to 40% of energy loss comes from unsealed gaps
- **ROI**: Insulation upgrades often pay for themselves within years

### Q: Are there financial incentives for insulation upgrades in Alaska?
**A:** Yes, several programs available:
- **Federal tax credits**: Inflation Reduction Act credits for energy improvements
- **AHFC programs**: Various financing and rebate options
- **Utility rebates**: Some utilities offer efficiency incentives
