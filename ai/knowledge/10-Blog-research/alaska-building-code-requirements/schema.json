The minimum requirement is 6 mil polyethylene sheeting (0.06 perm rating or lower) installed on the heated side of insulation. All seams must be properly lapped and sealed, and all penetrations for pipes, wires, and ducts must be sealed. The extreme temperature differentials in Alaska create intense vapor drive that can cause severe moisture damage without proper vapor control."

For spray foam insulation specifically, homeowners commonly see energy savings of 15-35% on heating bills. Given Alaska's high energy costs, proper insulation typically provides excellent return on investment."

            "text": "Spray foam insulation offers significant advantages for Alaska's extreme climate. It provides superior air sealing (up to 40% of energy loss comes from air leakage), high R-value per inch (R-6+ for closed-cell), acts as a vapor barrier (closed-cell), and maintains performance in subzero conditions. While initial costs are higher than traditional insulation, the combination of energy savings and longevity (80-100 years) typically provides strong return on investment."
