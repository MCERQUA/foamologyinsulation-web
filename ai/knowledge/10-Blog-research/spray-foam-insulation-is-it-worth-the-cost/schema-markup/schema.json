The higher upfront cost delivers dramatically better performance than traditional insulation, including complete air sealing that fiberglass can't provide."

During installation, chemical exposure risks exist, which is why professional installation and temporary evacuation are required. After curing, the foam becomes inert and poses no health risks."
