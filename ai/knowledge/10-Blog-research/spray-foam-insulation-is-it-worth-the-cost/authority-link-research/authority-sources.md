## Source Gaps Identified

### Missing Source Types
✅ **Well Covered**: Government sources, industry organizations, cost data, research institutions
⚠️ **Could Add**:
- Regional/local contractor association perspectives (if applicable to Foamology's service area)
- Specific manufacturer data sheets (if discussing product types)
- Local utility company rebate/incentive information

### Recommendations for Additional Research
1. **Climate-Specific Data**: If Foamology serves specific climate zones, could add region-specific energy savings data
2. **Manufacturer Technical Specs**: If discussing specific foam types (HFO-blown vs HFC-blown, etc.), manufacturer spec sheets could provide detail
3. **Local Building Codes**: While IBC covers general requirements, specific state/local amendments might be relevant
4. **Utility Rebates**: Local utility company programs could affect ROI calculations

**Note**: Current 15 sources provide excellent foundation across all key categories. Additional sources above would be supplementary, not essential.

## Notes & Warnings

### Source Reliability Notes
- **Compass Foam (Source 15)**: Industry source (contractor/manufacturer), so inherently has commercial bias. However, their ROI data (3-7 year payback) is conservative and aligns with independent sources. Use their data but balance with Consumer Reports and DOE for credibility.
- **EPA Archived Content (Source 2)**: EPA moved content to archive.epa.gov in 2021, but information remains authoritative and current regarding safety practices. No replacement page published, indicating guidance still valid.
- **NAHB Research (Source 10)**: Original research from 1992-1996 is older, but these are foundational studies that established spray foam's structural benefits. Still widely cited in industry. 2024 New American Home data provides current validation.

### Contradictory Information Found
- **Re-entry times**: EPA states 8-24 hours (one-component) or 23-72 hours (two-component), while some contractor sources say "24 hours minimum." Article should cite EPA's more conservative guidance.
- **Environmental impact**: Building Science Corporation notes improvements (removed ozone depleters) but Consumer Reports flags ongoing greenhouse gas concerns from some blowing agents. Article should acknowledge both: improvements made, but eco-friendly options still important.
- **Cost comparisons**: Sources vary on cost premium (100-300% more per Consumer Reports vs "only $1,000 difference" in some contractor examples). Article should provide range and note variability by project.

### Licensing Considerations
- All sources are publicly accessible web content
- No paywall restrictions (Consumer Reports article is free content)
- Standard fair use applies for quotes and data
- No permission required for linking and citing
- Recommend using brief quotes (1-2 sentences max) with proper attribution
