## CATEGORY 4: Application & Installation Questions

### Q13: Can you spray foam existing walls?
- **Search Volume:** MEDIUM
- **Featured Snippet Potential:** YES
- **Recommended Format:** Paragraph with yes/no + method explanation
- **Answer Length:** 100-150 words

**Answer Outline:**
Yes, but it requires injection foam (not standard spray foam). Contractors drill small holes in drywall, inject foam into wall cavities, then patch holes. However, walls only account for 7% of thermal loss—attics and air leaks are bigger priorities. Best approach: focus on attic first, then consider walls if budget allows. For new construction or major renovations, standard spray foam works better. Existing walls may have obstacles (wiring, plumbing) that complicate injection. Cost is higher per sq ft due to labor-intensive process.

   - Prevention: Clean, dry surfaces; maintain 65-90°F during application

6. **Ventilation Issues** - Creates too-tight house, traps CO2/VOCs without proper HVAC
   - Prevention: Install proper ventilation system for tightly sealed homes

7. **Structural Problems** - Over-expansion can warp framing; conceals roof damage
   - Prevention: Experienced installers who know proper expansion rates

**Key Takeaway:** Almost all problems stem from improper installation. Hire licensed professionals with warranties.

### Q25: Can spray foam cause mold?
- **Search Volume:** MEDIUM
- **Featured Snippet Potential:** YES
- **Recommended Format:** Paragraph with yes/no + explanation
- **Answer Length:** 100-150 words

**Answer Outline:**
Spray foam itself doesn't cause mold, but improper installation can create conditions for mold growth. Problem scenario: closed-cell foam traps moisture between foam and wall/roof, creating hidden mold that goes undetected. Common causes: (1) Spraying on wet surfaces (>20% moisture), (2) Not removing old wet insulation, (3) Gaps between foam and substrate, (4) Existing roof leaks concealed by foam, (5) Poor ventilation in tightly sealed homes. Prevention: inspect for moisture before installation, remove old insulation, ensure proper adhesion, maintain ventilation system, address water leaks before insulating. Open-cell foam is more breathable and less prone to trapped moisture issues.

### Q26: Will spray foam damage my roof?
- **Search Volume:** MEDIUM
- **Featured Snippet Potential:** YES
- **Recommended Format:** Paragraph with yes/no + circumstances
- **Answer Length:** 100-150 words

**Answer Outline:**
Properly installed spray foam won't damage roofs, but improper installation can cause problems. Risks: (1) Conceals existing roof leaks—moisture spreads undetected behind foam, (2) Eliminates roof ventilation—can cause overheating if not properly designed, (3) Makes roof inspection difficult—can't see damage until severe, (4) Expansion/contraction stress—improper application can warp roof deck. Benefits: strengthens roof structure (closed-cell), prevents ice dams, seals air leaks. Best practice: inspect roof thoroughly before foam application, address any leaks/damage, ensure proper ventilation design for unvented attic, hire experienced contractors who understand building science.

### Q27: Is spray foam hard to remove?
- **Search Volume:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Featured Snippet Potential:** NO
- **Recommended Format:** Paragraph
- **Answer Length:** 80-120 words

**Answer Outline:**
Yes, spray foam is very difficult and expensive to remove, especially closed-cell foam. Removal requires: cutting/scraping with specialized tools, chemical solvents (for some applications), professional labor ($2,000-$5,000+), disposal fees. Reasons for removal: improper installation odors, accessing wiring/plumbing, roof repairs, mold remediation. Open-cell foam is slightly easier to remove due to softer structure but still labor-intensive. This is why proper installation is critical—removal and reinstallation can cost more than original installation. Consider future access needs before installing spray foam.

## CATEGORY 8: Special Considerations

### Q28: Does spray foam require special HVAC considerations?
- **Search Volume:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Featured Snippet Potential:** NO
- **Recommended Format:** Paragraph
- **Answer Length:** 100-150 words

**Answer Outline:**
Yes, spray foam creates extremely tight homes that require proper ventilation. Considerations: (1) May need upgraded HVAC system with dedicated fresh air intake, (2) Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) or Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) recommended, (3) Smaller HVAC unit may work due to reduced heating/cooling needs, (4) Proper combustion air for gas appliances essential, (5) Prevents drafts that previously "ventilated" home. Benefits: HVAC runs less frequently (energy savings), more even temperatures, less dust/allergens. Consult HVAC professional before spray foam installation to ensure proper ventilation design. Tight homes without proper ventilation can trap CO2, VOCs, and moisture.
