# Phase 4: FAQ Research - R-Value Guide for Alaska

## Most Common Questions (Based on Search Data)

### R-Value Basics

**Q: What is R-value in insulation?**
A: R-value measures an insulating material's resistance to heat flow. The higher the R-value, the better the material insulates. For example, R-49 insulation resists heat transfer approximately twice as effectively as R-25 insulation.

**Q: How is R-value measured?**
A: R-value is determined according to US-FTC CFR Title 16 Part 460, measured in units of h·ft²·°F/Btu at a mean temperature of 75°F (24°C). It represents hours of heat retention per square foot per degree of temperature difference.

**Q: What factors affect R-value?**
A: R-value depends on the type of insulation, its thickness, and density. It can also be affected by temperature, aging, moisture accumulation, and compression. Compressed insulation provides lower R-value than its rated value.

### Alaska Requirements

**Q: What R-value do I need for my home in Alaska?**
A: Alaska recommends R-49 to R-60 for attics, R-21 to R-30 for walls, and R-25 to R-30 for floors. Most of Alaska is in Climate Zone 7, with some areas in Zone 8, which have the highest insulation requirements in the United States.

**Q: What is Alaska's building code for insulation?**
A: Alaska follows the Building Energy Efficiency Standard (BEES). The minimum requirements are:
- Ceiling: R-49
- Walls (above grade): R-20+5 or R-13+10
- Floors: R-38
- Windows: U-0.27 maximum

**Q: Which climate zone is Alaska in?**
A: Most of Alaska is in IECC Climate Zone 7. The following boroughs are in Zone 8 (subarctic): Bethel, Northwest Arctic, Dillingham, Southeast Fairbanks, Fairbanks N. Star, Wade Hampton, Nome, Yukon-Koyukuk, and North Slope.

**Q: Is Alaska insulation different from Lower 48 states?**
A: Yes, significantly. Alaska requires R-49 ceiling insulation (vs R-30-38 in most states), permafrost areas require special engineering, slab-on-grade needs full insulation (not just perimeter), and ground temperatures of 33°F create unique challenges.

### Energy Savings

**Q: How much can I save on heating bills with better insulation?**
A: Properly insulated Alaska homes can reduce heating costs by 30-50%. AHFC reports their weatherization programs have saved 50,000+ households an average of 30% annually. Individual savings depend on current insulation, home size, and heating source.

**Q: What is the payback period for insulation upgrades in Alaska?**
A: Due to Alaska's high heating costs and extended heating season, insulation upgrades typically pay back in 3-5 years. Some homeowners see payback in as little as 2 years with comprehensive upgrades.

**Q: Is spray foam worth the extra cost in Alaska?**
A: Generally yes. Spray foam's superior air sealing and higher R-value per inch are particularly valuable in Alaska's extreme climate. The 30-50% energy savings and 3-7 year payback period make it cost-effective for most Alaska homeowners.

### Insulation Types

**Q: What is the best insulation for Alaska homes?**
A: Closed-cell spray foam is considered optimal for Alaska due to its high R-value (R-6-7 per inch), moisture resistance, and air sealing properties. It's especially valuable for attics, crawl spaces, and any application where moisture control matters.

**Q: What's the difference between open-cell and closed-cell spray foam?**
A: Open-cell foam has R-3.5-3.7 per inch, is less expensive, and is good for interior walls and soundproofing. Closed-cell foam has R-6-7 per inch, acts as a vapor barrier, adds structural strength, and is best for Alaska's extreme conditions.

**Q: How does spray foam compare to fiberglass in Alaska?**
A: Spray foam provides R-6-7 per inch vs fiberglass R-2.2-3.8 per inch. Spray foam also seals air leaks (fiberglass doesn't), resists moisture, and lasts 80-100 years vs 15-20 for fiberglass. In Alaska's climate, spray foam's advantages are amplified.

### Special Considerations

**Q: Do I need different insulation in permafrost areas?**
A: Yes. Permafrost areas require engineering analysis for any ground-contact insulation. Buildings should be on open crawl spaces to minimize heat loss to the ground and prevent permafrost melting that causes structural settling.

**Q: Can I use slab-on-grade construction in Alaska?**
A: It's not recommended for main living areas. Ground temperatures in Alaska are near 33°F year-round. If used, the entire slab must have at least 2 inches of rigid foam insulation underneath. Perimeter-only insulation is not adequate for Alaska.

**Q: How do I prevent ice dams with proper insulation?**
A: Ice dams form when heat escapes through the roof, melting snow that refreezes at eaves. Proper R-49 attic insulation, combined with air sealing, prevents heat loss that causes ice dams. Spray foam on the roof deck is highly effective.

**Q: Should I insulate my basement walls in Alaska?**
A: Yes, below-grade basement walls should be insulated to at least R-15. Closed-cell spray foam is ideal as it provides both insulation and moisture control. This is especially important in Alaska where ground temperatures are consistently cold.

### Installation & Contractors

**Q: Can I install insulation myself in Alaska?**
A: For fiberglass batts in accessible areas, DIY is possible. However, spray foam requires professional installation due to chemical handling, specialized equipment, and safety requirements. Given Alaska's stringent requirements, professional assessment is recommended.

**Q: What certifications should an Alaska insulation contractor have?**
A: Look for SPFA (Spray Polyurethane Foam Alliance) certification, Alaska contractor licensing, liability insurance, and experience with Alaska's specific requirements. AHFC-certified weatherization contractors are also qualified.

**Q: How long does insulation installation take in Alaska?**
A: A typical attic spray foam project takes 1-2 days. Whole-house projects may take 3-5 days. Plan for 24-72 hours of vacating the home after spray foam installation for curing. Winter installations may require special heating considerations.

### Costs & Financing

**Q: What does insulation cost in Alaska?**
A: Costs are higher than the Lower 48 due to shipping and labor. Spray foam runs $1.50-$5.00 per square foot. Attic projects typically range $4,000-$8,000. AHFC offers rebates and weatherization assistance that can offset costs significantly.

**Q: Are there rebates for insulation in Alaska?**
A: Yes. AHFC offers the Home Energy Rebate Program with rebates up to $10,000 for energy efficiency improvements. Federal tax credits of up to 30% (max $1,200/year) are also available through the Inflation Reduction Act.

**Q: Does AHFC offer insulation financing?**
A: AHFC offers the Home Energy Loan Program with competitive interest rates for energy efficiency upgrades. Income-qualified homeowners may qualify for the Weatherization Assistance Program with free improvements.
