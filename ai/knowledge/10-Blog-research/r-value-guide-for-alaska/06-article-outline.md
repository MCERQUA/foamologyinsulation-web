## H2: R-Value Comparison by Insulation Type

### Comparison Table (Visual Component)
| Type | R-Value/Inch | Lifespan | Air Seal | Cost/SqFt |
|------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Closed-Cell Foam | R-6 to R-7 | 80-100 yrs | Yes | $1.50-$4.50 |
| Open-Cell Foam | R-3.5-3.7 | 80-100 yrs | Yes | $1.00-$3.00 |
| Fiberglass Batts | R-2.2-3.8 | 15-20 yrs | No | $0.10-$0.50 |
| Blown Cellulose | R-3.2-3.8 | 20-30 yrs | Partial | $0.50-$1.50 |
| Rigid Foam Board | R-4 to R-6.5 | 50+ yrs | Partial | $0.50-$2.00 |

### H3: Why Spray Foam Excels in Alaska
- Superior R-value per inch
- Complete air sealing (critical in Alaska)
- Moisture resistance
- Longevity in extreme conditions

### H3: Achieving R-49 in Your Attic
- Spray foam: ~7-8 inches closed-cell
- Fiberglass: 14-16 inches required
- Space and depth considerations

## H2: Energy Savings Potential in Alaska

### H3: How Much Can You Save?
- 30-50% reduction in heating costs
- AHFC data: 50,000+ households saved 30% annually
- Example calculations for typical Alaska home

### Energy Savings Calculator Concept (InfoBox)
- Current heating: $3,000-$5,000/year (Alaska average)
- With proper insulation: $1,500-$2,500/year
- Annual savings: $1,500-$2,500
- 10-year savings: $15,000-$25,000

### H3: Return on Investment Timeline
- Typical payback: 3-5 years in Alaska
- Faster than Lower 48 due to higher heating costs
- Long-term value with 80-100 year lifespan

### H3: Factors That Increase Savings
- Starting with poor/no insulation
- Air sealing combined with insulation
- Comprehensive approach (attic + walls + floors)
- Quality installation by professionals
