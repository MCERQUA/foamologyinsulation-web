## Internal Linking Strategy

### Article Sections → Internal Links

**Introduction Section:**
- Link to /services when mentioning "professional insulation"
- Link to /about when mentioning "Alaska insulation experts"

**R-Value Requirements Table:**
- Link to /services/attic-insulation when discussing R-49 ceiling requirements
- Link to /services/crawl-space-insulation when discussing floor insulation

**Climate Zone Section:**
- No specific internal links (external to IECC/AHFC)

**Insulation Types Comparison:**
- Link to /services/closed-cell-spray-foam for closed-cell references
- Link to /services/open-cell-spray-foam for open-cell references
- Link to /blog/spray-foam-insulation-is-it-worth-the-cost for cost analysis

**Energy Savings Section:**
- Link to /services/thermal-inspections for energy audits
- Link to /services/weatherization for comprehensive upgrades

**Special Considerations (Permafrost/Ice Dams):**
- Link to /ice-dam-prevention for ice dam solutions
- Link to /services/crawl-space-insulation for permafrost-safe construction

**FAQ Section:**
- Distribute links across answers:
  - Closed-cell foam questions → /services/closed-cell-spray-foam
  - Cost questions → /blog/spray-foam-insulation-is-it-worth-the-cost
  - Assessment questions → /services/thermal-inspections

**Call to Action:**
- Primary CTA → /contact or phone number
- Secondary CTA → /services/building-consultant

## Link Placement Rules

1. **Maximum 2-3 internal links per 500 words**
2. **First link should appear within first 200 words**
3. **Vary anchor text (don't use same text repeatedly)**
4. **Link to relevant service pages when naturally discussing topics**
5. **Use descriptive anchor text, not "click here"**
6. **Ensure links open in same tab (internal)**

## Recommended Link Distribution

| Section | Target # Links | Priority Pages |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Introduction | 1-2 | /services, /about |
| R-Value Table | 2-3 | /services/attic-insulation, /services/crawl-space-insulation |
| Insulation Types | 3-4 | Both spray foam pages, cost article |
| Energy Savings | 2 | /services/thermal-inspections, /services/weatherization |
| Special Considerations | 1-2 | /ice-dam-prevention |
| FAQ | 3-4 | Distributed across service pages |
| CTA | 1-2 | /contact, /services/building-consultant |

**Total Target: 13-18 internal links**
