# Phase 1: Topic Research - Alaska R-Value Guide

## Alaska Climate Zones Overview

### IECC Climate Zone Classification
- **Zone 7**: Most of Alaska
- **Zone 8 (Subarctic)**: Bethel, Northwest Arctic, Dillingham, Southeast Fairbanks, N. Star, Wade Hampton, Nome, Yukon-Koyukuk, and North Slope boroughs

## Alaska R-Value Requirements (BEES - Building Energy Efficiency Standards)

### Minimum R-Value Requirements by Component

| Component | Zone 7 | Zone 8 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Ceiling/Attic | R-49 | R-49+ |
| Walls (Above Grade) | R-20+5 or R-13+10 | R-21+10 |
| Walls (Below Grade) | R-15 | R-15+ |
| Floors | R-38 | R-38+ |
| Slab Edge | R-10 | R-10+ |
| Windows | U-0.27 | U-0.27 |

### 2024 IECC Updates
- Reduced ceiling insulation requirements in zones 2-8 (reverted to 2018 levels)
- Fenestration U-factor for zones 7 & 8 reduced from 0.30 to 0.27
- New option for continuous exterior insulation on walls:
  - Zone 6+: R-20 continuous insulation option

## Special Alaska Considerations

### Permafrost Areas
- Require engineering analysis for ground-contact insulation
- Floors should be over open crawl spaces
- Insulated to minimize heat loss and prevent permafrost melting
- Avoid uneven building settling

### Slab-on-Grade Construction
- Ground temperatures in Alaska: ~33°F
- Minimum: 2 inches rigid foam plastic insulation
- Perimeter insulation alone is NOT adequate for Alaska
- Full slab insulation recommended for living areas

### Door Requirements
- Region 1 & 2: Maximum one exterior door with R-value less than R-7

## Energy Savings Potential in Alaska

### Heat Loss Statistics
- 40%+ of home energy loss is due to air leakage
- Air infiltration can increase energy costs by 10-40%
- 56% of home energy use goes to heating/cooling (DOE)
- 35% of heat loss comes from poorly insulated attics in cold climates

### Spray Foam Energy Savings
- **Average savings**: 30-50% reduction in heating/cooling costs
- **Compared to fiberglass**: ~30% more energy efficient
- **Alaska testimonials**: 40% heating bill reduction reported
- **Modern homes**: 10-15% decrease in energy costs
- **Pre-1990 homes**: 15-30% decrease in energy costs
- **Uninsulated buildings**: 50% immediate cost reduction

### R-Value Efficiency Comparison
- Spray foam: R-38 achieved in <6 inches
- Fiberglass: R-38 requires up to 12 inches
- Closed-cell spray foam: R-6.5 to R-7 per inch
- Open-cell spray foam: R-3.5 to R-4 per inch

## Alaska Heating Degree Days Context

### Energy Cost Impact
- Average homeowner cuts energy costs by 33% after weatherization
- AHFC programs saved 50,000+ households 30% annually
- Lowering thermostat 1°F saves ~2% on heating bills

### Insulation ROI in Cold Climates
- Typical payback period: 3-5 years
- Heating cost reduction: 20-40%
- 2,000 sq ft home savings: $400-800 annually
- Caulk/weatherstripping: $50-100 materials, $200-300 yearly savings

## Key Takeaways for Article

1. Alaska has the most stringent insulation requirements in the US (Zones 7-8)
2. R-49 ceiling insulation is the minimum standard
3. Spray foam provides superior performance in extreme cold
4. Energy savings of 30-50% are achievable with proper insulation
5. Permafrost areas require special engineering consideration
6. Ground temperatures of 33°F make slab insulation critical
7. Air sealing is as important as R-value for Alaska homes
8. ROI on insulation upgrades is typically 3-5 years
