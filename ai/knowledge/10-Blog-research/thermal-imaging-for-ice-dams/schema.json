            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Ice dams form when heat escaping from your home warms the attic and roof deck, melting snow on the upper portions of your roof. This meltwater flows down toward the eaves, which remain cold because they extend beyond your home's heated envelope. When the water reaches these cold eaves, it refreezes, creating a dam of ice that causes water to back up under shingles and leak into your home."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Permanent ice dam prevention requires a three-part approach: 1) Air seal the attic to close all gaps that allow warm air to enter; 2) Add insulation to achieve R-49 to R-60; 3) Ensure proper ventilation from soffit to ridge. Spray foam insulation is particularly effective because it creates both the air barrier and thermal barrier simultaneously."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, spray foam is highly effective for ice dam prevention. Closed-cell spray foam provides R-7 per inch of insulation value while simultaneously creating an air barrier that stops warm air from entering the attic. When applied to the roof deck (unvented attic approach), spray foam eliminates the temperature differential that causes ice dams."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Absolutely. Thermal imaging cameras detect temperature variations that reveal insulation deficiencies. Missing insulation appears as hot spots where heat escapes, while areas with adequate insulation maintain consistent temperatures. Thermal imaging also reveals settling or compression in existing insulation, gaps around penetrations, and thermal bridging through framing members."

This investment provides detailed documentation of heat loss locations and prioritized recommendations for fixes. Compared to the cost of ice dam damage ($900-$6,200 per incident) or annual removal ($650-$2,400), thermal imaging is a modest investment in preventive diagnosis."

            "text": "Air sealing is actually most important, followed by insulation, with ventilation third. Air leakage is the primary way heat enters most attics. Adding insulation without air sealing often provides limited benefit because warm air still bypasses the insulation through gaps and cracks. For optimal results, all three work together."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Ice dams form when the attic temperature exceeds 30°F while outdoor temperatures remain below 22°F. This creates a temperature differential along the roof surface, with the area over the attic rising above freezing while the eaves stay below freezing. The 8-10°F difference enables the thaw-freeze cycle that creates ice dams."

            "text": "Winter is optimal because the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is greatest. The inspection requires at least 15-20°F difference between interior and exterior temperatures. The best times are early morning before sunrise or late evening after sunset, avoiding solar heating interference. Alaska winters provide excellent conditions from November through March."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes—the math strongly favors prevention. Annual ice dam removal costs $650-$2,400, damage repairs cost $900-$6,200 per incident, and energy waste adds 15-30% to heating bills. A one-time investment in proper air sealing and insulation ($3,000-$12,000) eliminates these recurring costs. Most homeowners recoup their investment within 3-5 years through combined energy savings and avoided damage costs."
