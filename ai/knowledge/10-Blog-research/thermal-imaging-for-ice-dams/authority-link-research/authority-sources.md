## Key Quotes by Topic

### What Ice Dams Are

> "An ice dam is a ridge of ice that forms at the edge of a roof and prevents melting snow (water) from draining off the roof. The water that backs up behind the dam can leak into a home and cause damage to walls, ceilings, insulation and other areas."
> - National Weather Service, Preventing Roof Ice Dams

> "Nonuniform roof surface temperatures lead to ice dams. For ice dams to form there must be snow on the roof and, at the same time, higher portions of the roof's outside surface must be above 32°F while lower surfaces are below 32°F."
> - University of Minnesota Extension, Dealing with and Preventing Ice Dams

### Primary Cause

> "Because the primary cause of ice dams is warm air leaking from the attic, the best prevention is to seal leaks with caulking or expanding spray foam, with attic insulation installed to a minimum of R-50 as space allows."
> - Minnesota Department of Commerce, Energy Tips

> "Ice dams are not a roofing problem; they're an air-sealing problem. Air-sealing the connection between the living space and the roof or attic and then improving insulation is usually the best way to solve the problem."
> - Fine Homebuilding, How to Fix Ice Dams

### Air Sealing Priority

> "The three best ways builders can combat ice dam formation are to fully air seal the ceiling plane, thoroughly insulate the attic, and ventilate the roof. The most important step is to seal all of the air leaks from the conditioned space into the attic space."
> - Building America Solution Center (DOE/PNNL)

> "By air sealing in your attic, you can stop many major air leaks and help to maintain the desired temperature throughout your home. Combined with attic insulation, air sealing can help to alleviate the formation of dangerous ice dams in the winter."
> - ENERGY STAR, Attic Air Sealing Project

### Insulation Requirements

> "Most experts agree the R-value of attic insulation should be at least R-30 (R-38 is preferable in northern climates)."
> - National Weather Service, Preventing Roof Ice Dams

> "The 2021 IECC prescriptive requirements: R-49 attic insulation in Climate Zones 2-3; R-60 in Climate Zones 4-8."
> - International Code Council, 2021 IECC

> "The amount of insulation depends on the snowfall and climate, but it is recommended that a minimum of R-30 should be provided below ventilated attic roof membranes, R-35 below ventilated cathedral ceilings, and R-40 below unvented cathedral ceilings."
> - NAIMA Canada, Preventing Ice Dams

### Thermal Imaging Applications

> "Weatherization contractors are professionals who can deal with the heat transfer problem that creates ice dams. The contractor you hire should conduct a blower door test to evaluate how airtight your ceiling is. They also may use an infrared camera to find places in the ceiling where there is excessive heat loss."
> - University of Minnesota Extension, Dealing with and Preventing Ice Dams

> "Thermography or infrared can help diagnose the problems you can't see visually, but can see thermally. Infrared technology provides an instant snapshot of any active heat loss through the outer portions of walls and ceilings."
> - Building Science Corporation, BSD-135

> "Thermal imaging can reveal energy loss and heat sources contributing to ice dams such as an uncapped heating duct supplying the attic space with unwanted heat."
> - This Old House, How to Stop Ice Dams with Attic Insulation

### Spray Foam Benefits

> "Ice dams can be prevented by controlling the heat loss from the home, so spray foam insulation can function as a comprehensive solution for the problems associated with ice dams. Spray foam naturally air seals while insulating, stopping warm, moist air from sneaking into the attic."
> - Spray Polyurethane Foam Alliance

> "When it comes to preventing ice dams, spray foam insulation installed in an unvented attic is a great choice. Closed-cell spray foam is moisture resistant and achieves R-38, which is ideal for preventing heat loss and ice dam formation."
> - This Old House, Tom Silva

### Warning Against Incomplete Solutions

> "Don't let a huckster talk you into a 'blow and go' job where they just install insulation and run. That will likely cause future problems like mold, allergy problems, and rot, and may not change your icicles at all."
> - Energy Vanguard, Allison Bailes III, PhD

> "Do not use heating cables to eliminate or prevent ice dams. They are hard on your roof and will shorten its life span. Plus, they are expensive to operate."
> - Minnesota Department of Commerce

> "Ventilation should always be the third step in fixing ice dams. If ridge vents are added without proper air-sealing, escaping attic air can depressurize the attic, increasing air leakage through the ceiling."
> - Fine Homebuilding

### Professional Diagnostics

> "Air sealing strategies shall be determined based on blower door diagnostic results, visual inspection of critical by-pass areas, and indoor air quality evaluations for each home."
> - Building Performance Institute, Air Leakage Control Standards

> "The contractor you hire should conduct a blower door test to evaluate how airtight your ceiling is. They also may use an infrared camera to find places in the ceiling where there is excessive heat loss."
> - University of Minnesota Extension

- Always balance industry sources with independent sources (government/university/expert)

### Contradictory Information Found

**Insulation R-Value Recommendations:**
- Range from R-30 minimum to R-60 depending on source and climate zone
- **Resolution**: Present as spectrum based on climate severity, cite 2021 IECC code as definitive standard
- **Article Strategy**: "Minimum R-30 in warmer zones, R-38 to R-49 in northern climates, up to R-60 in coldest regions (per 2021 building code)"

**Vented vs. Unvented Attics:**
- Some sources favor vented attics (traditional approach, UMN Extension, Building Science Corporation in heavy snow)
- Other sources favor unvented/conditioned attics (spray foam industry, This Old House)
- **Resolution**: Present both approaches with appropriate contexts (vented for heavy snow regions, unvented viable in moderate snow with proper design)
- **Article Strategy**: Explain both methods, note Building Science Corporation research showing vented necessary in extreme snow, position spray foam unvented approach as viable for appropriate climates

**Role of Ventilation:**
- Traditional sources emphasize ventilation importance
- Modern building science (Energy Vanguard, Building Science Corporation) emphasizes ventilation is secondary to air sealing/insulation
- **Resolution**: Air sealing and insulation are primary; ventilation is important but tertiary
