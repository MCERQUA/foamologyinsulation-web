### H2: The Primary Cause of Ice Dams: Heat Loss Through Your Attic (450-500 words)
**Purpose:** Explain root cause, set up thermal imaging solution

**H3: Air Leaks: The Hidden Culprit**
- Air leakage accounts for 30-40% of home heat loss
- Common leak sources: recessed lights, plumbing stacks, electrical penetrations
- Stack effect: warm air rises and escapes through ceiling
- Most heat enters attic through air leaks, not insulation gaps

**H3: Inadequate or Damaged Insulation**
- Many Alaska homes have R-19 to R-30 (code requires R-49+)
- Insulation settles and compresses over time
- Gaps around penetrations
- Thermal bridging through rafters

**H3: Ventilation Issues**
- Blocked soffit vents (insulation installed over vents)
- Inadequate ridge venting
- Bathroom/dryer vents exhausting into attic

**Key Point:** Air sealing is MORE important than adding insulation alone

### H2: How Thermal Imaging Detects Ice Dam Risk Factors (500-550 words)
**Purpose:** Explain thermal imaging technology and its application

**H3: What Is Thermal Imaging and How Does It Work?**
- Infrared cameras detect heat radiation
- Creates thermal map showing temperature variations
- Hot spots (red/orange) = heat loss
- Cold spots (blue/purple) = air infiltration
- Non-invasive: no drilling or demolition needed

**H3: What Thermal Imaging Reveals About Your Home**
- Missing or compressed insulation
- Air leaks around penetrations (outlets, pipes, lights)
- Thermal bridging through framing
- Moisture from existing leaks
- Improperly installed soffit vents
- Hidden air bypasses

**H3: When Is the Best Time for Thermal Imaging?**
- Winter months are optimal (temperature differential)
- Requires 15-20°F+ difference between inside and outside
- Early morning (before sunrise) or late evening (after sunset)
- Avoid sunny days (solar heating interference)
- Alaska winters provide ideal conditions

**H3: Professional vs. DIY Thermal Imaging**
- Professional cameras: $6,000-$24,000, higher sensitivity
- Consumer cameras: $150-$1,000, lower resolution
- Interpretation requires training and experience
- Professionals provide comprehensive solution recommendations
- DIY good for monitoring, not diagnosis

### H2: Spray Foam Insulation: The Complete Ice Dam Prevention Solution (550-600 words)
**Purpose:** Position spray foam as superior solution, commercial intent section

**H3: Why Spray Foam Outperforms Traditional Insulation for Ice Dams**
- Creates both air barrier AND thermal barrier
- Stops air leaks at source (traditional insulation doesn't)
- Closed-cell: R-7 per inch (vs. R-3.6 fiberglass)
- No settling or compression over time
- 80-100 year lifespan (vs. 10-15 years for fiberglass)
- Moisture resistant (closed-cell)

**H3: Unvented Attic: The Modern Approach**
- Spray foam applied to roof deck underside
- Conditions attic space as part of home
- Eliminates need for attic ventilation
- No ice dam formation possible (roof stays cold)
- Ideal for HVAC equipment in attic
- Works for complex roof designs

**H3: Traditional Attic: Air Sealing + Insulation + Ventilation**
- Spray foam seals all air bypasses
- Additional insulation to R-49 or R-60
- Proper ventilation installed (1:150 ratio)
- Three-part system working together

**H3: ROI of Spray Foam for Ice Dam Prevention**
- One-time cost vs. annual removal ($650-$2,400/year)
- Energy savings: 15-40% reduction in heating bills
- Prevents $900-$6,200 damage repairs
- Increases home resale value
- 525% ROI over 20 years (based on research)

### H2: What About Other Ice Dam Prevention Methods? (350-400 words)
**Purpose:** Address alternatives, reinforce spray foam advantages

**H3: Heat Cables (De-icing Cables)**
- Only move where ice dam forms
- Don't address root cause
- Cost: $470-$1,500 installed
- Ongoing energy costs to operate
- Can damage roofing materials
- Temporary solution at best

**H3: Roof Raking**
- Removes symptom, not cause
- Must be done after every snowfall
- Can damage shingles if done improperly
- Labor intensive and potentially dangerous
- Improper technique can worsen ice dams

**H3: Ventilation Alone**
- Cannot exhaust enough heat if air leaks exist
- Adding ridge vents without air sealing can worsen problem
- Part of solution, not the solution
- Must work with air sealing and insulation

**Key Takeaway:** Only addressing root cause (heat loss) provides permanent solution
