### Section 4: The Three-Part Ice Dam Prevention Strategy (700-800 words)
**H2:** Permanent Ice Dam Prevention: The Three-Part Strategy

**Subsections:**
- **H3:** Part 1: Air Sealing (The Most Important Step)
  - Quote: "Air tightness, air tightness, air tightness" - Dr. Lstiburek
  - Air leaks are PRIMARY cause of ice dams
  - Common leak sources:
    - Recessed can lights
    - Plumbing stacks and chimneys
    - Attic hatches and stairs
    - Electrical wiring gaps
    - Top plates and drywall seams
  - Must seal BEFORE adding insulation

- **H3:** Part 2: Proper Insulation Requirements
  - R-value requirements by climate zone:
    - R-30 minimum (all climates)
    - R-38 preferred (northern climates)
    - R-49 to R-60 (coldest regions)
  - Insulation types comparison:
    - Blown-in cellulose: reaches all gaps
    - Spray foam: R-7/inch, best for limited spaces
    - Fiberglass batts: lower performance
  - Critical areas: roof edges where dams form

- **H3:** Part 3: Adequate Ventilation
  - Purpose: keep attic cold in winter
  - Ridge vents + continuous soffit vents
  - 1 sq ft opening per 150-300 sq ft attic floor
  - Ventilation baffles maintain 2" airspace
  - Note: ventilation alone is NOT sufficient

- **H3:** Why You Need All Three (Not Just One)
  - Each addresses different heat transfer mechanism
  - Air sealing: stops convective heat loss
  - Insulation: stops conductive heat loss
  - Ventilation: removes residual heat
  - Thermal imaging identifies which components are failing
