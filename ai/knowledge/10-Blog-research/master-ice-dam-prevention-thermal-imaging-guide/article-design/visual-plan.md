## Image Optimization Requirements

After generation, all images must be optimized:

1. **Resize** to max 1200px width
2. **Convert** to JPEG if not needed for transparency
3. **Compress** to 80% quality
4. **Target** under 300KB per image
5. **Verify** no AI-generated people/workers appear

---

## Notes

- Hero image should be abstract/conceptual, NOT showing spray foam application
- All diagrams should be clean, professional, corporate style
- Use consistent color palette across all images
- Thermal imagery should use standard cold-to-hot color scales
- Focus on data visualization and educational diagrams
- No stock photo style images with people
