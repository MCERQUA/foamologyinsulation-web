## Key Statistics for Article

- Ice dams cause 22% of all homeowner insurance claims ($4,024 average)
- 40% of Minnesota homes have insulation below code
- Air leakage accounts for 30-40% of total heat loss
- R-30 minimum, R-38 preferred for northern climates
- 20°F minimum temperature difference for accurate thermal imaging
- Thermal imaging cost: $200-$500 (vs. thousands in damage)
- Steam removal cost: $800-$2,400

## Content Strategy

### Differentiator
Position thermal imaging as the essential diagnostic tool that competitors ignore. Most competitors focus on basic prevention tips - Foamology's advantage is scientific, data-driven approach using thermal imaging.

### Article Structure (Recommended)
1. Introduction - What are ice dams and why they matter
2. How Ice Dams Form - The science with thermal imaging visualization
3. The Three-Part Prevention Strategy
   - Air Sealing (MOST IMPORTANT)
   - Proper Insulation (R-values by climate)
   - Adequate Ventilation
4. How Thermal Imaging Reveals Ice Dam Risk
5. Professional vs. DIY Solutions
6. Cost Comparison: Prevention vs. Damage Repair
7. Comprehensive FAQ Section (30+ questions)
8. Conclusion with CTA

### Target Word Count
3,500 - 5,000 words (comprehensive guide format)
