      - Detects dampness behind walls/under floors
      - Identifies damage not visible to eye
      - Should confirm with moisture detector

47. **"What should I do if I have an ice dam?"**
    - **Search Intent:** Emergency response
    - **Frequency:** Very High (URGENT)
    - **Answer Approach:** Comprehensive emergency checklist
    - **Ranking Potential:** High competition - HIGH URGENCY CONVERSION
    - **Immediate Actions:**
      - Don't try to chip away ice (roof damage risk)
      - Remove snow from roof if safe (roof rake from ground)
      - Call professional ice dam removal service
      - Document damage for insurance
