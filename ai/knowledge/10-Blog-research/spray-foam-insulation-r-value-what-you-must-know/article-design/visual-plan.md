## Implementation Notes

### File Naming Convention
All images use format: `XX-description-kebab-case.png`
- 01 = Featured/hero image
- 02-07 = Section-specific images

### Image Generation Order
1. Generate all images using Gemini image generation
2. Save to `/article-design/images/`
3. Optimize to under 300KB each
4. Verify all images render correctly

### Responsive Considerations
- All images work at 1:1 aspect ratio for consistent display
- Mobile-friendly sizing (max-width: 100%)
- Include loading="lazy" attribute in HTML

### Alt Text SEO
All alt texts include primary and secondary keywords naturally:
- "spray foam"
- "R-value"
- "insulation"
- "closed-cell" / "open-cell"
