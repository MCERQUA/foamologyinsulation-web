## H2: What is R-Value and Why Does It Really Matter?

### Word Count: 300-350 words

**H3: The Simple Definition**
- R-value = thermal resistance (how well insulation resists heat flow)
- Higher number = better insulating performance
- Calculated: thickness divided by thermal conductivity

**H3: What R-Value Measures (And What It Doesn't)**
- Measures conductive heat transfer only
- Does NOT measure: air movement (convection), moisture effects
- Critical insight: Standard R-value tests assume zero wind, zero moisture
- This is why spray foam often outperforms fiberglass at "equal" R-values

### Word Count: 350-400 words

**Comprehensive Comparison Table:**

| Factor | Open-Cell | Closed-Cell |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| R-Value Per Inch | R-3.5 to R-3.9 | R-6.0 to R-7.0 |
| Density | 0.4-0.5 lb/ft³ | 1.5-2.2 lb/ft³ |

## H2: How to Calculate Required Spray Foam Thickness

### Word Count: 350-400 words

**Simple Calculation Formula:**
Required Thickness = Required R-Value ÷ R-Value Per Inch

**Calculation Examples:**

**Example 1: Achieving R-30 in Attic**
- Closed-cell: R-30 ÷ R-6.5 = 4.6 inches
- Open-cell: R-30 ÷ R-3.7 = 8.1 inches

**Example 2: Achieving R-49 in Attic**
- Closed-cell: R-49 ÷ R-6.5 = 7.5 inches
- Open-cell: R-49 ÷ R-3.7 = 13.2 inches
- Hybrid approach: 2" closed-cell (R-13) + fiberglass batts (R-36) = R-49

**H3: Thickness by Application**
- Walls (2x4): 3-3.5 inches - R-10.5 to R-24.5
- Walls (2x6): 5.5 inches - R-19.25 to R-38.5
- Attic: 6-12 inches depending on climate zone
- Crawl space walls: 2-3 inches minimum

**H3: The Flash-and-Batt Strategy**
- Thin layer of closed-cell (1-2 inches) for air seal
- Fill remainder with fiberglass batts for R-value
- Cost-effective way to achieve high R-values

- Open-cell: Commonly 9-14 inches
- Closed-cell: Commonly 5-8 inches
- Unvented attic special requirements

**H3: Wall R-Value Requirements**
- Zones 1-3: R-13 to R-20
- Zones 4-8: R-20+5 or R-13+10 continuous insulation
- 2x4 wall max: R-15 to R-24.5

## H2: Does Spray Foam Maintain R-Value Over Time?

### Word Count: 300-350 words

**H3: Understanding Aged R-Value vs Initial R-Value**
- Initial R-value: Immediately after installation (slightly higher)
- Aged R-value: After 6-12 months (advertised value)
- Manufacturers must test at aged values per industry standards

**H3: The Truth About Thermal Drift**
- Most drift occurs in first 6 months to 2 years
- Total R-value loss: fraction of a percent
- Not significant compared to fiberglass settling or moisture absorption
- Spray foam maintains performance for 50-80 years

**H3: Comparison to Other Insulation Types**
- Fiberglass: Can lose R-value from settling, compression, moisture
- Cellulose: Settles over time, requires overfill
- Spray foam: Minimal change once cured

## H2: Why R-Value Isn't the Whole Story

### Word Count: 400-450 words

**H3: The Air Sealing Advantage**
- 30-40% of energy loss is from air leakage, not conduction
- Spray foam creates monolithic air barrier
- Reduces HVAC workload by up to 40%
- Oak Ridge study: spray foam 0.08 ACH vs fiberglass 0.16 ACH

**H3: Thermal Bridging: The Hidden R-Value Killer**
- Wood framing is only R-1.2 per inch
- 25% of wall area is typically framing
- R-30 cavity insulation = only R-16-20 whole-wall R-value
- This is why closed-cell's higher R-value advantage diminishes in practice

**H3: Whole-Wall R-Value vs Cavity R-Value**
- Cavity R-value: Just the insulation
- Whole-wall R-value: Entire wall assembly including framing
- Building scientists focus on whole-wall performance
- Spray foam's air sealing provides more benefit than extra R-value

**H3: The Complete Performance Picture**
- Air barrier + thermal barrier + moisture management
- Spray foam provides all three in one application
- This is why performance exceeds what R-value alone suggests

## H2: Is Higher R-Value Always Better? Understanding Diminishing Returns

### Word Count: 300-350 words

**H3: The Concept of Diminishing Returns**
- First inches provide most benefit
- Each additional inch provides less incremental improvement
- Cost increases linearly; benefit does not

**H3: Where the Cutoff Points Are**
- Air seal threshold: 2" closed-cell, 3" open-cell (critical)
- Sweet spot for most applications: 4-6 inches closed-cell
- Beyond 6 inches: diminishing returns unless required by code

**H3: When More IS Better**
- Very cold climates (zones 6-8)
- Meeting code requirements
- Extreme temperatures (hot or cold)
- Commercial applications

**H3: Cost-Effective Strategies**
- Meet air seal minimum first
- Consider flash-and-batt for cost savings
- Focus on whole-wall performance, not just cavity R-value

## H2: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ Section)

### Word Count: 400-450 words

**Q1: What is the R-value of spray foam per inch?**
A: Closed-cell spray foam provides R-6.0 to R-7.0 per inch, while open-cell provides R-3.5 to R-3.9 per inch.

**Q2: Which has higher R-value: open-cell or closed-cell?**
A: Closed-cell has nearly double the R-value per inch (R-6-7) compared to open-cell (R-3.5-3.9).

**Q3: How thick should spray foam be in attic?**
A: Depends on climate zone: typically 5-8 inches of closed-cell or 9-14 inches of open-cell to meet R-49 to R-60 requirements.

**Q4: Does spray foam lose R-value over time?**
A: Minimal loss occurs (fraction of a percent). Advertised R-values are "aged" values representing long-term stable performance.

**Q5: Is higher R-value always better?**
A: Not necessarily. Beyond the minimum for air sealing (2" closed-cell, 3" open-cell), returns diminish. Air sealing provides more benefit than extra R-value.

**Q6: What R-value do I need for my climate zone?**
A: Ranges from R-30 (warm climates) to R-60+ (cold climates) for attics; R-13 to R-20+ for walls.

**Q7: How does spray foam R-value compare to fiberglass?**
A: Spray foam provides R-3.5 to R-7.0 per inch vs fiberglass R-3.2-3.8. More importantly, spray foam also provides air sealing, which fiberglass cannot.

**Q8: Is spray foam worth the higher cost?**
A: Yes for most applications. Energy savings of 30-50% provide 3-7 year payback. Spray foam also lasts 50-80 years vs 10-25 for fiberglass.

**Q9: What is the minimum thickness for air sealing?**
A: 2 inches for closed-cell, 3 inches for open-cell to create an effective air barrier.

**Q10: Can I achieve R-49 with spray foam alone?**
A: Yes, with 7.5" of closed-cell or 13" of open-cell. Flash-and-batt hybrids offer cost-effective alternatives.
