## KEY QUOTES BY TOPIC

### R-Value Definition

> "An insulating material's resistance to conductive heat flow is measured or rated in terms of its thermal resistance or R-value — the higher the R-value, the greater the insulating effectiveness."
— **U.S. Department of Energy**, Energy.gov

> "Spray polyurethane insulation typically has an initial R-value around R-3.4 to R-6.7 per inch."
— **U.S. Department of Energy**, Energy.gov

### Performance & Air Sealing

> "BioBased spray foam-insulated structure experienced 0.08 air changes per hour at 4 pascals of pressure, while the fiberglass-insulated structure experienced 0.16 ACH under the same conditions."
— **Oak Ridge National Laboratory**, Buildings Technology Center

> "Research from Oak Ridge National Laboratory shows spray foam can cut heating and cooling costs by 30–50%, with HVAC systems running 35% less due to reduced thermal load."
— **Oak Ridge National Laboratory**, Research Summary

> "A study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that closed cell spray foam could reduce air leakage by as much as 30% to 50%, significantly improving the overall energy efficiency of buildings."
— **Oak Ridge National Laboratory**, Energy Efficiency Study

### Building Science Expertise

> "High density foam (2.0 pcf) ranges between R-5.5 and R-6.5 per inch for the aged R-value, and low density foam (0.5pcf) has an R-value of approximately R-3.6/inch."
— **Building Science Corporation**, GM-2102: Residential Spray Foam Guide

> "What really matters is the R-value of the whole wall, not just that of the insulation."
— **Fine Homebuilding**, Understanding R-Value Article

> "Spray foam insulation reduces air leakage better than any other type of insulation. When installed correctly, closed-cell spray foam performs better than any other insulation."
— **Fine Homebuilding**, Buyer's Guide to Insulation

### Code Requirements

> "With the updated 2021 IECC, minimum energy requirements have increased to R-49 for ceiling insulation in climate zones 2 and 3, and R-60 for ceiling insulation in climate zones 4 and higher."
— **International Energy Conservation Code**, 2021 IECC

> "Climate zones 4 and higher now require R-30 insulation in walls."
— **International Energy Conservation Code**, 2021 IECC Updates

### Industry Standards

> "Medium-density SPF can fulfill the balance of the R-Value requirement with fibrous insulation materials. When using low-density SPF, it should be applied to a thickness that achieves the desired air-sealing, then covered with fibrous insulations to meet R-Value requirements."
— **Spray Polyurethane Foam Alliance**, SPFA-147 Technical Document

> "Attic insulation may not be installed without first verifying the presence of an effective air barrier between the attic and living space via visual inspection and pressure differential testing."
— **Building Performance Institute**, Technical Standards for Envelope Professional
