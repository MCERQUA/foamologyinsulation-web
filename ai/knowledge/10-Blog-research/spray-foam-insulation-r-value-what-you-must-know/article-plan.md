## Key Content Elements

### Must-Include R-Value Data
- Closed-cell: R-6.0 to R-7.0 per inch (aged)
- Open-cell: R-3.5 to R-3.9 per inch
- Fiberglass: R-3.2 to R-3.8 per inch
- Building Science Corporation source for all specs

### Critical Statistics to Include
- 30-50% energy bill reduction (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
- 35% less HVAC runtime (ORNL)
- 30-50% less air leakage vs fiberglass
- 3-7 year ROI payback period
- 70-200% increase in wall racking strength
- 50-80 year lifespan

### Key Points to Emphasize
1. R-value alone doesn't tell the whole story
2. Air sealing is equally or more important than R-value
3. Thermal bridging reduces whole-wall R-value by 30-40%
4. Both open-cell and closed-cell provide air sealing
5. 2021 IECC updated requirements significantly

### Tables Required
1. R-Value Per Inch Comparison Chart
2. Open-Cell vs Closed-Cell Comprehensive Comparison
3. Climate Zone R-Value Requirements (IECC 2021)
4. Spray Foam vs Fiberglass Feature Comparison
5. Thickness Calculation Examples

### FAQ Questions to Answer (10)
1. What is the R-value of spray foam per inch?
2. Which has higher R-value: open-cell or closed-cell?
3. How thick should spray foam be in attic?
4. Does spray foam lose R-value over time?
5. Is higher R-value always better?
6. What R-value do I need for my climate zone?
7. How does spray foam R-value compare to fiberglass?
8. Is spray foam worth the higher cost?
9. What is the minimum thickness for air sealing?
10. Can I achieve R-49 with spray foam alone?
