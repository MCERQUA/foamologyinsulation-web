## Image 1: Featured Hero
**Filename:** 01-featured-hero.png
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
**Purpose:** Article header image showing conceptual cross-section

**Gemini Prompt:**
Create a professional technical cross-section diagram of a crawl space foundation showing insulation installation. The diagram should show a cutaway view of a house foundation with labeled components: concrete foundation walls, floor joists, subfloor, vapor barrier on ground, and spray foam insulation applied to walls. Use a clean, architectural illustration style with a warm/cool color scheme showing heat retention (warm orange inside, cool blue outside). Include arrows showing heat flow and energy efficiency. NO people, NO workers. Style: technical illustration, clean lines, educational diagram. Professional infographic quality.

**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1
**Purpose:** Pricing comparison by material type

**Gemini Prompt:**
Create a professional cost breakdown infographic comparing crawl space insulation costs by material type. Show pricing per square foot and total cost for a typical 1,200 sq ft crawl space: Closed-Cell Spray Foam ($3-5/sq ft, total $3,600-6,000), Open-Cell Spray Foam ($1.50-3/sq ft, total $1,800-3,600), Rigid Foam Board ($2-4/sq ft, total $2,400-4,800), Fiberglass Batts ($0.50-1.50/sq ft, total $600-1,800). Include icon representations of each material type. Use bar chart or column chart visualization with color coding. Add annotation showing "includes labor + materials". Modern, clean infographic design with professional typography.

## Image 5: Encapsulation vs Insulation
**Filename:** 05-encapsulation-vs-insulation.png
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1
**Purpose:** Visual comparison of two approaches

**Gemini Prompt:**
Create a side-by-side comparison diagram showing "Crawl Space Insulation Only" vs "Full Encapsulation with Insulation". Left side shows: insulation on walls, vented crawl space, potential moisture issues (illustrated with droplet icons). Right side shows: insulation on walls, vapor barrier on floor and walls, sealed vents, dehumidifier (illustrated), cleaner environment. Use cross-section architectural style with labels and arrows. Include checkmarks for benefits and X marks for drawbacks. Color code: basic insulation in blue tones, full encapsulation in green tones showing superior protection. Professional technical illustration style.

**Filename:** 06-arizona-rebates.png
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
**Purpose:** Financial incentives visualization

**Gemini Prompt:**
Create a professional financial incentives infographic showing crawl space insulation savings opportunities in Arizona. Display three stacked sections: Federal Tax Credit (up to 30% of cost, max $1,200), Arizona State Rebates ($500-1,000 available), and Utility Company Incentives (APS/SRP $200-500). Show total potential savings example: "$2,000+ in combined incentives". Include calculator icon, money/savings icons, and Arizona state outline. Use green color scheme for savings. Add timeline showing "2025 incentives available now". Professional business infographic with clear hierarchy and visual flow.
