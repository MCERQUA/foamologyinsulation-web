# Source Discovery Report: Crawl Space Insulation
**Topic**: Crawl Space Insulation: Stop Cold Floors NOW!
**Research Date**: December 20, 2025
**Total Sources Found**: 15
**Quality Threshold**: High Authority Only

## Executive Summary
The source landscape for crawl space insulation is exceptionally strong, with comprehensive coverage from federal government agencies (DOE, EPA), academic research institutions (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), industry organizations (NAIMA, SPFA), and expert publications (Building Science Corporation, Fine Homebuilding). The research reveals a clear consensus: sealed, conditioned crawl spaces outperform traditional vented designs in energy efficiency (up to 20% savings), moisture control, and indoor air quality. Arizona-specific programs offer significant financial incentives ($2,700-$4,500 total) for homeowners upgrading insulation.

## Notes & Warnings

### Source Reliability Notes
- **Building Science Corporation**: While not a .gov source, BSC's Dr. Joseph Lstiburek is widely recognized as the leading building science expert in North America. His work directly influences DOE Building America program and building codes.

- **Advanced Energy**: Non-profit status ensures research objectivity. Their crawl space studies are the most frequently cited in the industry.

- **Fine Homebuilding**: Commercial publication but highly respected in professional contractor community. Editorial standards ensure technical accuracy.

- **Koala Insulation**: Commercial contractor website - use only for rebate compilation information, not technical claims. Verify rebate details with official sources.

### Contradictory Information
- **Ventilation requirements**: Some sources say "unvented" while others say "conditioned with mechanical ventilation." The consensus is that sealed crawl spaces still need some form of moisture control (dehumidification or mechanical ventilation), but not passive exterior vents.

- **R-value requirements**: Vary by climate zone and IRC version (2018 vs 2021). Always cite specific climate zone and code version when making R-value claims.

### Licensing Considerations
- All sources are publicly accessible and can be linked to without restriction
- Quotes should follow fair use guidelines (short excerpts with attribution)
- No paywalled content included - all sources are free to access
- Government sources (.gov) are public domain and can be freely used
