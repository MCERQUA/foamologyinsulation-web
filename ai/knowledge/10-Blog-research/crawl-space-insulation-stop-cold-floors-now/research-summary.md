## Combined Research Findings

### Core Message
Modern building science has fundamentally shifted from vented crawl spaces with fiberglass ceiling insulation to **sealed, conditioned crawl spaces with spray foam wall insulation**. This approach delivers:
- 15-30% reduction in heating/cooling costs
- 3-7 year typical ROI
- Up to 20% energy savings in Phoenix's desert climate
- Protection against moisture, mold, and structural damage

### Key Statistics
- 50% of indoor air originates from crawl spaces (stack effect)
- Federal tax credit: 30% of materials (max $1,200/year) through Dec 31, 2025
- Arizona rebates: $2,700-$4,500 total potential savings
- Average cost: $3,550 for 1,000 sq ft crawl space
- Cost range: $1-$5 per square foot
