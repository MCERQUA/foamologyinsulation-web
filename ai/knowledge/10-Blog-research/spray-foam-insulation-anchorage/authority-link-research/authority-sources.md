## Source Gaps Identified

### Missing Source Types
1. **Recent Alaska Case Studies** - No published case studies from 2023-2024 showing specific Anchorage spray foam installations with energy savings data
   - Recommendation: Consider creating original case study content from local Foamology installations

2. **Alaska Energy Utility-Specific Programs** - Limited information on Chugach Electric or ML&P (now Chugach) specific rebates
   - Recommendation: Contact local utilities directly for current programs

3. **Alaska Native Housing Authority Resources** - Limited coverage of tribal housing insulation programs
   - Recommendation: Research Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium programs if targeting broader Alaska audience

4. **Anchorage-Specific Building Department Resources** - No direct Municipality of Anchorage building code links found
   - Recommendation: Add direct link to Anchorage building department if available

5. **Local Anchorage Contractor Association** - Anchorage Home Builders Association website found but limited technical resources
   - Recommendation: Contact AHBA for member resources or technical bulletins

### Recommendations for Additional Research

**High Priority:**
- Contact Foamology Insulation for permission to create case study from their Anchorage installations (original content opportunity)
- Research Chugach Electric current energy efficiency rebate programs
- Find Anchorage-specific building permit requirements for spray foam

**Medium Priority:**
- Search for Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation indoor air quality resources related to spray foam
- Look for University of Alaska Anchorage research on building energy efficiency
- Find Alaska-specific HVAC contractor resources related to spray foam and building tightness

**Low Priority:**
- Regional EPA Region 10 resources for Alaska
- Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs energy resources
- Anchorage Economic Development Corporation sustainability initiatives

## Notes & Warnings

### Source Reliability Notes
- **EPA Archive Links**: EPA SPF safety content is archived from 2017 but remains the most authoritative federal guidance available. Content is still valid and referenced by industry.

- **CCHRC/NREL Transition**: Cold Climate Housing Research Center became part of NREL in 2020. Sources reference both CCHRC.org and NREL Alaska Campus - both are valid and authoritative.

- **Alaska Energy Code**: Alaska has no mandatory statewide energy code, but AHFC-financed homes must meet 2018 IECC-based standards. This creates two-tier system (code vs. voluntary).

- **Climate Zone Variations**: Alaska spans zones 5-8 depending on borough. Anchorage is primarily Zone 7, but some sources reference Zone 8 for coldest areas. Always specify when citing zone-specific data.

- **Rebate Program Status**: Home Efficiency Rebate and Home Electrification programs allocated but not fully launched as of research date. AHFC warns of scams - always verify program status before promoting.

### Contradictory Information
- **Spray Foam Thickness Requirements**: Building Science Corporation recommends >1.5 inches closed-cell for vapor control in zones 5-8, while CCHRC Alaska research suggests 6 inches for Fairbanks (Zone 8). This is not contradictory - CCHRC recommendation is for retrofit moisture safety margin in extreme cold, while BSC is minimum for vapor control. Use both contextually.

- **Re-occupancy Times**: EPA states "some manufacturers recommend 24 hours" but emphasizes following specific manufacturer instructions. Always recommend following manufacturer-specific guidelines rather than generic timeframes.

### Licensing Considerations
- All government sources (.gov, .us domains) are public domain
- Industry organization content (SPFA, BPI, ICC) may be copyrighted - link but do not reproduce extensive content
- Research institution content (BSC, CCHRC) - link to resources, brief quotes with attribution acceptable under fair use
- Local contractor websites - verify permission if featuring specific companies beyond directory listings

### URL Stability
- Alaska state websites (.alaska.gov, .ahfc.us) are stable
- EPA archive links are permanent but note archived status
- UpCodes Alaska Energy Code link is third-party database - verify periodically
- Trade association URLs (SPFA, BPI, ICC) are stable
- Research institution URLs stable but CCHRC content may migrate to NREL over time
