Closed cell spray foam maintains its R-value and structural integrity even at -40°F or colder. The air sealing properties are particularly valuable in Alaska, where preventing heat loss from air infiltration is critical for energy efficiency and comfort."

            "text": "Closed cell spray foam is strongly recommended for all exterior applications in Alaska homes, including walls, attics, crawl spaces, and foundations. Its higher R-value per inch, vapor barrier properties, and moisture resistance make it the clear choice for Alaska's extreme climate. Open cell foam has limited use for interior soundproofing applications."

For an Anchorage home spending $2,800 annually on heating, that translates to $840 or more in yearly savings. These savings come from both the high R-value insulation and the complete air sealing that prevents heat loss through gaps and cracks."

Unlike fiberglass which can sag, settle, and lose R-value over time, spray foam maintains its performance permanently. It requires no maintenance and doesn't need replacement like traditional insulation."

When properly applied to the attic floor or roof deck, it creates a complete air barrier that eliminates the heat loss causing ice dams. Combined with adequate R-value (R-49+), spray foam addresses both the insulation and air sealing needed to prevent ice dam formation."
