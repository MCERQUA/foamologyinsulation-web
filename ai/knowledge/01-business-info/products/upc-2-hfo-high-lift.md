## Why R-7.9 Matters

The R-7.9 per inch rating is one of the highest available in closed-cell spray foam. This is **13-32% higher** than industry standard closed-cell foam (R-6 to R-7).

### Thickness Comparison to Achieve Target R-Values

| Target R-Value | UPC 2.0 HFO (R-7.9) | Standard CC (R-7) | Standard CC (R-6.5) |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| R-20 | 2.5" | 2.9" | 3.1" |
| R-30 | 3.8" | 4.3" | 4.6" |
| R-38 | 4.8" | 5.4" | 5.8" |
| R-49 | 6.2" | 7.0" | 7.5" |
| R-60 | 7.6" | 8.6" | 9.2" |

### Material Savings

For an Alaska attic requiring R-49:
- **UPC 2.0 HFO (R-7.9):** 6.2 inches needed
- **Standard closed-cell (R-7):** 7.0 inches needed
- **Savings:** 0.8 inches less foam = ~11% less material

## Environmental Benefits

The HFO (Hydrofluoroolefin) blowing agent offers significant environmental advantages:

- **GWP of 1** - compared to older HFC agents with GWP of 700-1400
- **Zero ozone depletion potential (ODP)**
- **Drop-in replacement** for older HFC-blown foams
- Meets California and other state environmental regulations

## Application Details

- **Processing Temperature:** Check TDS for specific temps
- **Shelf Life:** 6 months when stored at 50°F-75°F
- **Mixing Ratio:** 1:1 by volume (A + B components)
- **Application:** Spray-applied using professional foam equipment

## Competitive Advantage for Foamology

Foamology's use of UPC 2.0 HFO High Lift provides:

1. **Superior thermal performance** - R-7.9 vs industry R-6.5-7
2. **Environmental leadership** - Ultra-low GWP blowing agent
3. **Efficiency** - Fewer passes needed with 4" max lift
4. **Cost efficiency** - Less material needed for same R-value
5. **Premium quality** - Third-generation technology with full certifications
