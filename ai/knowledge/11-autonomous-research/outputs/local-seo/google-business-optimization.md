## Q&A Section Management

### Pre-populate Common Questions

**Q1: How much does spray foam insulation cost?**
```
A: Spray foam insulation costs typically range from $1.50 to $3.50
per square foot, depending on the type (open-cell vs closed-cell)
and the specific application. For an accurate estimate for your
Alaska home, please call us at (907) 310-3000 for a free assessment.
We'll measure your space and provide a detailed quote based on your
specific needs and energy goals.
```

**Q2: What areas do you serve?**
```
A: Foamology Insulation serves all of Southcentral Alaska, including:
- Anchorage (all neighborhoods)
- Eagle River and Chugiak
- Mat-Su Valley (Wasilla, Palmer, Big Lake, Houston)
- Kenai Peninsula (Soldotna, Kenai, Homer, Seward)
- Girdwood

We're happy to travel throughout our service area. Call (907) 310-3000
to confirm service to your specific location.
```

**Q3: Is spray foam worth it in Alaska?**
```
A: Absolutely! Alaska's extreme cold and high energy costs make spray
foam one of the best investments you can make. Spray foam provides:
- Highest R-value per inch (R-7 for closed-cell)
- Complete air sealing
- Moisture control
- Ice dam prevention
- 50+ year lifespan

Most Alaska homeowners see 30-50% reduction in heating costs. Plus,
you may qualify for AHFC rebates. Call us for a free assessment to
see your potential savings!
```

**Q4: Do you offer free estimates?**
```
A: Yes! We provide free, no-obligation estimates for all residential
and commercial insulation projects. Our estimates include:
- On-site assessment of your property
- Thermal imaging inspection (when available)
- Detailed scope of work
- Written quote with pricing
- Energy savings projections

Call (907) 310-3000 to schedule your free estimate today!
```

**Q5: How long does spray foam installation take?**
```
A: Most residential spray foam projects are completed in 1-2 days,
depending on the size and scope. A typical attic insulation project
takes about 4-6 hours for application, plus prep and cleanup time.
Larger projects or whole-home insulation may take 2-3 days. We'll
provide a timeline estimate during your free consultation.
```

**Q6: Can you help with ice dam problems?**
```
A: Yes! Ice dams are one of the most common reasons Alaska homeowners
call us. Ice dams form when heat escapes through inadequate attic
insulation. Our solution includes:
- Thermal imaging to identify heat loss
- Spray foam attic insulation
- Air sealing of penetrations
- Proper R-value for Alaska climate

This addresses the root cause of ice dams, not just the symptoms.
Call (907) 310-3000 for a free ice dam assessment!

2. Kenai Peninsula (Soldotna)

**Requirements for Additional GBP:**
- Physical address with signage
- Regular staffing at location
- Local phone number
- Separate GBP for each location
- Avoid duplicate content issues
