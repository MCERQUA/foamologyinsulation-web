## FAQ Categories & Questions

### Category 1: General Spray Foam Questions (10 Questions)

**Q1: What is spray foam insulation?**
*Word Count: 100-120 words*

Spray foam insulation is a two-component polyurethane foam applied as a liquid that expands and hardens into a solid insulation layer. Unlike traditional insulation like fiberglass batts, spray foam expands to fill gaps and creates both insulation and an air barrier in one application.

There are two types:
- **Closed-cell**: Dense (2 lb/cu ft), R-6.5-7 per inch, vapor barrier
- **Open-cell**: Lighter (0.5 lb/cu ft), R-3.5-4 per inch, excellent air sealing

Spray foam is the most effective insulation for Alaska homes because it stops both heat loss through conduction AND air leakage—the two main causes of energy waste.

**Q2: How does spray foam insulation work?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

Spray foam works through a chemical reaction when two components (isocyanate and polyol resin) are mixed and sprayed. The mixture expands 30-60 times its liquid volume, filling cavities, gaps, and cracks. Once cured (24-48 hours), it forms a rigid insulation layer that resists heat transfer and blocks air movement.

The key advantage: spray foam creates a continuous insulation layer with no gaps or seams, unlike batts or loose-fill that leave spaces for air to leak through.

---

**Q3: What are the types of spray foam insulation?**
*Word Count: 120-150 words*

**Closed-Cell Spray Foam**
- Density: 2 lbs per cubic foot
- R-Value: 6.5-7.0 per inch
- Properties: Vapor barrier, adds structural strength, moisture resistant
- Best for: Crawl spaces, basements, exterior walls, areas with limited space

**Open-Cell Spray Foam**
- Density: 0.5 lbs per cubic foot
- R-Value: 3.5-4.0 per inch
- Properties: Excellent air sealing, sound dampening, cost-effective
- Best for: Attics, interior walls, areas where sound control matters

Both types provide superior air sealing compared to traditional insulation. The right choice depends on your specific application.

**Q4: What is the R-value of spray foam insulation?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

R-value measures insulation's resistance to heat flow. Higher = better.

**Spray Foam R-Values:**
- Closed-cell: R-6.5 to R-7.0 per inch
- Open-cell: R-3.5 to R-4.0 per inch

For comparison:
- Fiberglass batts: R-2.9 to R-3.8 per inch
- Cellulose: R-3.2 to R-3.7 per inch

Alaska typically requires R-49 to R-60 in attics. With spray foam, you can achieve this with less thickness than other insulation types.

[See our R-Value Guide](/resources/r-value-guide)

---

**Q5: How long does spray foam insulation last?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

Spray foam insulation lasts 50+ years—essentially the lifetime of your home. Unlike fiberglass (which settles and degrades in 15-25 years) or cellulose (20-30 years), spray foam maintains its R-value indefinitely.

Key durability factors:
- Doesn't settle or compress
- Won't absorb moisture
- Resists mold and mildew
- Chemically stable

The only threats are physical damage or water intrusion from other sources. With proper installation, you'll never need to replace your spray foam insulation.

**Q6: Is spray foam insulation safe?**
*Word Count: 120-150 words*

Yes, spray foam insulation is safe when properly installed and fully cured.

**During installation:**
- Our installers wear protective equipment
- Occupants should vacate during application
- Proper ventilation is maintained
- We follow all safety protocols

**After curing (24-48 hours):**
- Spray foam is completely inert
- No off-gassing occurs
- Safe for occupants including children and pets
- No ongoing health concerns

Spray foam has been used safely for over 50 years. The key is professional installation by trained, certified contractors who follow manufacturer guidelines.

We take safety seriously and ensure your home is completely safe before you return.

---

**Q7: Does spray foam insulation off-gas?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

During the first 24-48 hours after installation, spray foam does release gases as it cures. This is why we recommend occupants stay elsewhere until curing is complete.

After full curing:
- No ongoing off-gassing
- Spray foam becomes completely inert
- Safe for sensitive individuals
- No odors

Our curing protocols ensure your home is safe before you return. We never rush this process. Proper cure time is essential for both safety and performance.

---

**Q8: Can spray foam insulation get wet?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

**Closed-cell spray foam**: Highly water-resistant. Closed cells don't absorb water, making it ideal for flood-prone areas, crawl spaces, and below-grade applications. It can get wet without losing insulation value.

**Open-cell spray foam**: Can absorb water. While it will dry out, it's not recommended for areas with water exposure. Best used in dry locations like attics.

If your spray foam gets wet from a leak or flood, closed-cell will be fine. Open-cell should be inspected for damage.

---

**Q9: Does spray foam insulation prevent mold?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

Spray foam helps prevent mold in two ways:

1. **Air sealing** stops moisture-laden air from entering wall cavities where condensation causes mold
2. **Closed-cell foam** doesn't absorb water, eliminating the moisture mold needs

However, spray foam doesn't kill existing mold. If you have mold, it must be remediated before insulation.

Spray foam is not food for mold—it won't grow on the foam itself. Combined with proper moisture management, spray foam significantly reduces mold risk.

---

**Q10: Is spray foam insulation fire-resistant?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

Spray foam insulation is treated with fire retardants and meets building code fire safety requirements. However, it is combustible and will burn if exposed to direct flame.

Fire safety facts:
- Spray foam must be covered with approved thermal barrier (drywall) in living spaces
- In attics, it can remain exposed per most codes
- It won't spontaneously ignite
- Passes all required fire tests for residential use

Our installations always meet Alaska fire code requirements.

It depends on the application:

**Choose closed-cell for:**
- Crawl spaces and basements
- Areas with moisture exposure
- Exterior walls
- Limited space situations

**Choose open-cell for:**
- Attics (most common)
- Interior walls
- Soundproofing needs
- Budget-conscious projects

Many homes benefit from both: closed-cell in moisture-prone areas, open-cell in attics.

**Q40: Can I install spray foam myself?**
*Word Count: 100-120 words*

DIY spray foam is possible for small projects, but NOT recommended for whole-home insulation.

**DIY spray foam kits:**
- Available at hardware stores
- Suitable for small gaps and patches
- Limited coverage
- Difficult to apply evenly

**Problems with DIY:**
- Poor application = poor results
- Safety risks without proper equipment
- No warranty or guarantee
- Often costs more to fix mistakes

**Professional installation advantages:**
- Proper equipment and training
- Consistent, correct application
- Warranty included
- Code compliance
- Much better results

For significant insulation projects, professional installation is always recommended.

**Q41: Is it worth replacing existing insulation with spray foam?**
*Word Count: 80-100 words*

Often, yes—especially if:

- Current insulation is 20+ years old
- You have high energy bills
- Comfort issues exist (drafts, cold rooms)
- Ice dams are a problem
- Moisture or mold has been an issue

**When it might NOT be worth it:**
- Existing insulation is adequate and recent
- No energy or comfort problems
- Moving soon

We assess your current insulation and recommend whether replacement makes sense for your situation.
