# Internal Linking Strategy - Foamology Insulation

**Created:** December 19, 2025
**Purpose:** Comprehensive guide to internal linking across all topic clusters
**Total Pages Covered:** 110+ pages across 10 clusters

---

## Internal Linking Fundamentals

### Why Internal Links Matter

1. **SEO Value Distribution** - Links pass authority (PageRank) from strong pages to weaker pages
2. **Crawlability** - Help search engines discover and index all pages
3. **User Navigation** - Guide visitors through the customer journey
4. **Topic Relevance** - Signal to search engines which topics are related
5. **Conversion Optimization** - Direct users toward contact/quote pages

### Core Linking Principles

1. **Every page should have at least 3 internal links IN**
2. **Every page should link out to at least 3 other pages**
3. **Pillar pages are the hub - they link to/from all cluster pages**
4. **Use keyword-rich anchor text (but vary it naturally)**
5. **Link contextually within content, not just in sidebars**
6. **High-value pages should be within 2-3 clicks of the homepage**

## Anchor Text Strategy

### Anchor Text Guidelines

1. **Use target keyword in anchor text** (but don't over-optimize)
2. **Vary anchor text for the same destination** (natural variation)
3. **Include surrounding context** (naked URLs look unnatural)
4. **Match user intent** (what would they expect to find?)

### Anchor Text Examples by Page Type

**For Spray Foam Guide Pillar:**
- "complete spray foam guide"
- "spray foam insulation guide"
- "learn more about spray foam"
- "our comprehensive guide"
- "understanding spray foam"

**For Closed Cell vs Open Cell:**
- "closed cell vs open cell comparison"
- "comparing spray foam types"
- "which spray foam is right for you"
- "closed cell and open cell differences"
- "foam type comparison guide"

**For Anchorage Location Page:**
- "spray foam insulation in Anchorage"
- "our Anchorage services"
- "Anchorage area service"
- "serving Anchorage homeowners"
- "Anchorage insulation experts"

**For Contact Page:**
- "get a free estimate"
- "contact us today"
- "schedule your consultation"
- "request a quote"
- "reach out to our team"

### Anchor Text Distribution

For any given destination page, aim for this mix:
- **50%**: Keyword-focused (target keyword or variation)
- **30%**: Natural/contextual ("learn more", "this guide", etc.)
- **20%**: Branded or generic ("Foamology's guide", "our services")

## Specific Linking Recommendations

### High-Priority Pages (Need Maximum Links IN)

| Page | Target Links IN | Sources |
|------|----------------|---------|
| /spray-foam-insulation-cost | 25+ | All service pages, all comparison pages, pillar pages |
| /service-areas/anchorage | 15+ | Homepage, all service pages, Alaska cluster |
| /spray-foam-insulation-guide | 20+ | All spray foam cluster pages, homepage |
| /contact | 50+ | CTAs on every page, every cluster page |
| /services/spray-foam-insulation | 15+ | Related clusters, cost page, comparisons |

### Orphan Page Prevention

**Check monthly for:**
- Pages with fewer than 3 incoming links
- New pages not yet linked from pillar
- Old pages that need link refresh

**Fix orphan pages by:**
1. Adding links from relevant pillar pages
2. Including in related cluster content
3. Adding to service page "related content" sections
