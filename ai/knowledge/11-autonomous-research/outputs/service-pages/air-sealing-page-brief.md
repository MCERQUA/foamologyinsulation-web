## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (250-300 words)

**Opening Hook:**
You can pile on R-60 insulation in your attic, but if your home leaks air like a sieve, you're still heating the outdoors. Air leakage is the hidden energy thief in Alaska homes—invisible, constant, and expensive. The Department of Energy identifies air sealing as one of the highest-ROI home improvements available.

**Problem Statement:**
The average home has the equivalent of a 2-3 square foot hole in the building envelope—air escaping continuously, 24 hours a day. In Alaska, where indoor-outdoor temperature differences can exceed 100°F, every bit of that leakage costs you money. Worse, the leaking air carries moisture that can cause mold, rot, and indoor air quality problems.

**Solution Introduction:**
Professional air sealing identifies and eliminates air leakage throughout your home. Using spray foam, caulk, weatherstripping, and specialized techniques, we seal the gaps, cracks, and penetrations that allow conditioned air to escape and outdoor air to infiltrate.

**Why Foamology:**
As spray foam specialists, we're experts at air sealing. Spray foam is the most effective air sealing material available, and we apply it throughout our insulation work. We also offer standalone air sealing services for homes that need targeted improvement.

### 2. Understanding Air Leakage (350-400 words)

**What is Air Leakage?**
Air leakage (also called air infiltration) is the uncontrolled movement of air through cracks, gaps, and openings in your home's building envelope. Warm air escapes (exfiltration), while cold outdoor air enters (infiltration).

**The Stack Effect:**
Your home operates like a chimney. Warm air rises and exits through upper levels (attic, ceiling penetrations, upper windows), while replacement air is drawn in at lower levels (basement, crawl space, lower walls). This creates continuous air movement even with all windows and doors closed.

**Why Air Sealing Matters More Than Insulation Alone:**

The relationship between insulation and air sealing:
- Insulation resists heat conduction through materials
- Air sealing stops heat loss through air movement
- Air movement can bypass insulation entirely

Studies show that air leakage accounts for 25-40% of heating energy loss in homes. This is often more significant than inadequate insulation R-values.

**Common Air Leakage Points:**

| Location | % of Total Leakage |
|----------|-------------------|
| Plumbing penetrations | 13% |
| Ductwork leaks | 15% |
| Fireplace & chimney | 14% |
| Electrical outlets | 2% |
| Windows & doors | 10% |
| Recessed lights | 5% |
| Attic access hatches | 3% |
| Exhaust fans | 4% |
| Rim joists & sill plates | 15% |
| Other (numerous small leaks) | 19% |

**Air Leakage Measurement:**
Air leakage is measured in Air Changes per Hour (ACH) or Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM). A blower door test quantifies your home's leakage:
- Very leaky homes: 10+ ACH50
- Average older homes: 7-10 ACH50
- Modern code-built homes: 3-5 ACH50
- High-performance homes: 1-2 ACH50

### 3. Signs Your Home Needs Air Sealing (300-350 words)

**Physical Symptoms:**

**Drafts:**
Noticeable air movement near windows, doors, outlets, or along baseboards indicates air infiltration. Cold air enters wherever warm air exits.

**Cold Floors:**
Floors over crawl spaces or garages that feel cold despite heating suggest air leakage at the floor system.

**Uneven Temperatures:**
Rooms that are consistently hotter or colder than others often relate to air leakage patterns.

**Frost/Ice on Walls:**
Interior frost or ice indicates exterior air reaching wall surfaces—a serious leakage problem.

**Dust Accumulation:**
Excessive dust, especially around outlets and fixtures, indicates air movement carrying particles.

**Behavioral Indicators:**

**High Heating Bills:**
If heating costs seem excessive for your home's size and insulation, air leakage is often the culprit.

**Thermostat Struggles:**
Heating systems that run constantly without reaching set temperature may be fighting air leakage.

**Humidity Problems:**
Dry winter air (despite humidifier) or moisture issues can relate to air exchange rates.

**Testing Methods:**

**DIY Smoke Test:**
On a windy day, hold an incense stick near suspected leak points. Smoke movement indicates air flow.

**Blower Door Test:**
Professional test using calibrated fan to depressurize home and measure total leakage. Provides precise data on leakage rate.

**Thermal Imaging:**
Infrared cameras reveal temperature differences at air leakage points. We use thermal imaging to identify specific leak locations.

**Our Assessment:**
We offer free assessments including visual inspection and thermal scanning of major leakage points. For comprehensive testing, blower door tests provide definitive data.

### 7. Alaska Climate Considerations (250-300 words)

**Extreme Temperature Differentials:**
The 80-120°F temperature difference between heated interior and Alaska winter exterior creates extreme pressure driving air movement. Every gap acts like a vacuum pulling cold air in and pushing warm air out.

**Stack Effect Amplification:**
The stack effect is proportional to temperature differential. In Alaska:
- Summer: Minimal stack effect
- Winter: Maximum stack effect
- Greatest air leakage during coldest weather (when it hurts most)

**Moisture Implications:**
Warm, humid indoor air leaking into cold assemblies deposits moisture:
- Condensation in walls and ceilings
- Frost/ice formation in attics
- Mold and rot potential

Air sealing prevents this moisture migration.

**Building Code Requirements:**
Alaska's energy code includes air leakage requirements. New homes must demonstrate acceptable air tightness. Existing home improvements should target similar performance.

**Practical Ventilation:**
Tight homes need controlled ventilation. After air sealing:
- Bathroom and kitchen exhaust remain important
- Consider heat recovery ventilator (HRV) for very tight homes
- Controlled air exchange better than uncontrolled leakage
