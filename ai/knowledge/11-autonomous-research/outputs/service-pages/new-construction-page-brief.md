## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (200-250 words)

**Opening Hook:**
The insulation decisions made during construction determine your building's energy performance for decades. In Alaska's extreme climate, those decisions matter more than anywhere else. Choose spray foam, and you're building a high-performance home from day one. Choose wrong, and you're locking in energy waste for generations.

**Problem Statement:**
Many builders still default to fiberglass batts—familiar, inexpensive, and inadequate for Alaska. The result: homes that meet minimum code but leave homeowners with higher-than-expected heating bills, comfort complaints, and ice dam problems.

**Solution Introduction:**
Spray foam insulation in new construction eliminates these compromises. With superior R-value, complete air sealing, and permanent performance, spray foam creates homes that exceed expectations—and exceed minimum code requirements.

**Why Foamology:**
We work with builders throughout Anchorage and Mat-Su Valley, providing reliable scheduling, quality installation, and expertise in Alaska building requirements. We're a partner you can count on project after project.

### 2. Why Spray Foam in New Construction (350-400 words)

**Build Better From the Start:**

**Superior Thermal Performance:**
Spray foam delivers R-6.5 to R-7.0 per inch (closed cell), exceeding fiberglass by 80-100%. This means:
- Higher R-values in same wall thickness
- Or thinner walls for same R-value
- Flexibility in design

**Complete Air Sealing:**
The biggest advantage in new construction: spray foam air seals as it insulates. No additional air barrier needed. No gaps at penetrations. Complete envelope in single application.

**Code Compliance (and Beyond):**

Alaska energy code requires:
- Walls: R-20 cavity + R-5 continuous (or equivalent)
- Attics: R-49
- Floors: R-38

Spray foam solutions:

| Assembly | Spray Foam Approach | Result |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| 2x6 Wall | 5.5" closed cell | R-37 (exceeds code) |
| Attic (roof deck) | 4" closed cell | R-26 + conditioned attic |
| Attic (floor) | 12" open cell | R-44+ |
| Floor over crawl | Wall encapsulation | Exceeds R-38 effective |

**Moisture Management:**
Closed cell at 2"+ acts as vapor retarder. No separate vapor barrier needed (in most assemblies). Simplified wall assembly, fewer installation mistakes.

**Long-Term Value:**
- Spray foam doesn't settle or degrade
- Maintains R-value indefinitely
- 50+ year performance expectation
- No re-insulation needed

**Builder Benefits:**

**Scheduling Reliability:**
We understand construction timelines. Committed schedule = no delays.

**Quality Certainty:**
Spray foam fills completely every time. No installation quality issues.

**Differentiation:**
Spray foam homes perform noticeably better. Happy homeowners = referrals.

**Warranty Coverage:**
Our workmanship + manufacturer warranties = protected builder reputation.

### 3. New Construction Applications (350-400 words)

**Attic Insulation:**

**Option A: Roof Deck (Unvented)**
Closed cell foam applied to roof deck underside:
- Creates conditioned attic
- Ideal for HVAC in attic
- Superior ice dam prevention
- Usable attic space

**Option B: Attic Floor (Vented)**
Open cell foam on attic floor:
- Traditional vented attic approach
- Lower cost than roof deck
- Good thermal performance
- R-49+ achievable

**Exterior Walls:**

**Full Cavity:**
Fill entire wall cavity with spray foam:
- 2x4: 3.5" closed cell = R-24
- 2x6: 5.5" closed cell = R-37
- 2x8: 7" closed cell = R-48

**Flash and Batt:**
1-2" closed cell + fiberglass/cellulose:
- Air barrier + vapor retarder from foam
- Cost savings from reduced foam
- Good performance compromise

**Crawl Space:**

**Wall Approach:**
Insulate crawl space walls (conditioned crawl space):
- 2-3" closed cell on walls
- Vapor barrier on floor
- Rim joist sealed

**Floor Approach:**
Insulate floor above crawl space:
- Spray foam to subfloor underside
- Crawl space remains unconditioned
- May need pipe protection

**Rim Joists:**

Critical location often overlooked. Spray foam at all rim joist areas:
- 3" closed cell recommended
- Major air sealing benefit
- Simple installation during framing

**Specialty Applications:**

**Bonus Rooms:**
Spaces over garages or cantilevered areas:
- Difficult to insulate with batts
- Spray foam fills completely
- Eliminates cold floor problems

**Cathedral Ceilings:**
Limited depth for insulation:
- Closed cell maximizes R-value
- Open cell with proper depth
- Proper assembly design critical

### 4. Working with Builders (300-350 words)

**Our Partnership Approach:**

**Design Phase:**
We're available during design to advise on:
- Insulation specifications
- Assembly details
- Code compliance paths
- Cost optimization

**Pre-Construction:**
Before framing begins:
- Review plans and specifications
- Identify spray foam scope
- Establish scheduling
- Confirm pricing
