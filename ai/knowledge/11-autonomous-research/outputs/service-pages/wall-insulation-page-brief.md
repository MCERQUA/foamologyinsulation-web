## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (250-300 words)

**Opening Hook:**
Those cold spots on your walls aren't just uncomfortable—they're costing you money every minute of every Alaska winter. Exterior walls are the largest surface area of your home's thermal envelope, and when they're under-insulated, you're essentially trying to heat the outdoors.

**Problem Statement:**
Many Alaska homes have wall insulation that's inadequate, deteriorated, or missing entirely. Older homes may have original fiberglass batts that have sagged, settled, or never filled cavities properly. Some walls were never insulated at all. The result: cold wall surfaces, drafty rooms, frost on interior walls, and heating bills that never seem to stop climbing.

**Solution Introduction:**
Professional wall insulation with spray foam transforms your home's thermal performance. Unlike batts that leave gaps and allow air movement, spray foam expands to fill every inch of the cavity, bonds to framing and sheathing, and creates an air barrier that stops heat loss cold.

**Why Foamology:**
We've insulated hundreds of Alaska walls—both in new construction and existing homes. We understand the specific challenges of Alaska wall assemblies: extreme temperature differentials, vapor management in cold climates, and the need for performance that never diminishes.

### 2. Signs Your Walls Need Insulation (300-350 words)

**Physical Signs:**

**Cold Wall Surfaces:**
If interior wall surfaces feel cold to the touch during winter, heat is conducting through inadequate insulation. Properly insulated walls should feel close to room temperature.

**Drafts Near Walls:**
Air movement along exterior walls indicates air leakage through the wall assembly. This can occur through gaps in insulation, electrical outlets, and penetrations.

**Frost or Condensation on Walls:**
Interior frost or moisture on walls during cold weather signals serious insulation deficiency. The wall surface is cold enough to reach dew point—a major problem.

**Uneven Room Temperatures:**
Rooms with exterior walls significantly colder than interior rooms suggest wall insulation problems. Temperature differences of 5°F+ are concerning.

**Behavioral Signs:**

**High Heating Bills:**
If heating costs seem excessive despite reasonable thermostat settings, wall insulation may be a major contributor.

**Thermostat Wars:**
Different family members feeling too hot or too cold in the same space often relates to cold surfaces and drafts from wall problems.

**HVAC Running Constantly:**
Heating systems that never seem to satisfy the thermostat may be fighting heat loss through poorly insulated walls.

**Visual Signs:**

**Ice on Exterior Walls:**
Ice forming on exterior wall surfaces (particularly at corners) indicates heat escaping through the wall.

**Higher Snow Melt at Walls:**
Snow melting faster against the house than on adjacent surfaces shows heat loss through walls.

**Inspection Methods:**

**Thermal Imaging:**
Infrared cameras reveal heat loss through walls definitively. We offer thermal inspections to identify problem areas.

**Outlet Test:**
Carefully removing an outlet cover on an exterior wall may reveal insulation condition and presence.

**Professional Assessment:**
Our free assessments include visual inspection, thermal scanning (when appropriate), and evaluation of existing insulation condition.

**Option 3: Injection Foam (For Enclosed Walls)**

Retrofit solution for existing walls without demolition:
- Foam injected through small holes in wall
- Fills enclosed cavities from inside or outside
- Less disruptive than spray foam

**Best For:**
- Retrofit applications
- Historic buildings
- When drywall removal not feasible

**Considerations:**
- Lower R-value than spray foam
- May not fill all voids
- Cannot air seal penetrations

**Option 4: Flash-and-Batt System**

Combines spray foam air sealing with traditional insulation:
- 1-2" closed cell foam for air/vapor barrier
- Remainder filled with fiberglass or cellulose
- Compromise between performance and cost

**Best For:**
- Budget projects needing some spray foam benefits
- Code compliance with cost control
- New construction with specific assemblies

**Our Recommendation:**
For Alaska exterior walls, **closed cell spray foam** provides the best combination of R-value, air sealing, and moisture management. The extreme temperature differentials in Alaska demand robust wall assemblies, and closed cell delivers.

For interior walls (soundproofing, room-to-room separation), **open cell spray foam** is typically the better value—superior sound control at lower cost.

### 4. New Construction vs. Retrofit (350-400 words)

**New Construction Wall Insulation**

**Advantages:**
- Open access to all cavities
- Can specify wall depth (2x6, 2x8) for more insulation
- Optimal spray foam application conditions
- Can integrate with whole-home energy strategy

**Process:**
1. Framing complete, sheathing installed, windows in place
2. Spray foam applied to all exterior wall cavities
3. Rim joists included
4. All penetrations sealed
5. Inspection before drywall

**Specifications for New Construction:**
| Wall Type | Foam Thickness | R-Value |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 2x4 | 3.5" (full cavity) | R-24 |
| 2x6 | 5.5" (full cavity) | R-37 |
| 2x6 + 1" exterior | 5.5" + 1" | R-43 |

**Retrofit Wall Insulation**

Insulating existing walls requires different approaches:

**Method 1: Interior Access (Preferred)**
- Remove drywall on one side
- Apply spray foam directly
- Replace drywall
- Best results, but most disruptive

**Method 2: Drill-and-Inject**
- Drill holes through drywall or exterior siding
- Inject foam into cavities
- Patch holes
- Less disruptive, but less thorough

**Method 3: Exterior Access**
- Remove siding sections
- Drill through sheathing
- Inject foam
- Replace siding

**Retrofit Challenges:**
- Fire blocking may divide cavities
- Electrical and plumbing create obstacles
- Existing insulation may need removal
- Quality verification difficult

**Retrofit Realities:**
Retrofit wall insulation can significantly improve performance, but expectations should be realistic:
- May achieve 70-90% of new construction performance
- Some voids may be unavoidable
- Costs higher per R-value than new construction
- Still provides major improvement over uninsulated walls

**When Retrofit is Worth It:**
- Walls currently uninsulated
- Extensive renovation already planned
- Comfort problems severe
- Energy costs very high
- Planning to stay in home long-term

### 7. Alaska Climate Considerations (250-300 words)

**Extreme Temperature Performance:**
Alaska walls experience 80-120°F temperature differentials. This extreme difference:
- Drives constant heat flow outward
- Creates significant vapor pressure
- Stresses building materials
- Demands high-performance insulation

Closed cell spray foam handles these differentials better than any other wall insulation.

**Vapor Management:**
Cold climates create strong vapor drive from warm (inside) to cold (outside). If moisture enters the wall and condenses, problems result:
- Wood rot in framing
- Mold growth
- Insulation degradation
- Paint failure

Closed cell foam's vapor retarder properties prevent moisture migration, keeping wall assemblies dry.

**Thermal Bridging:**
Wood framing conducts heat more readily than insulation. In a typical wall, 15-25% of surface area is framing—creating thermal bridges. Spray foam's continuous contact with all surfaces minimizes thermal bridging compared to batts.

**Air Sealing in Cold Climates:**
Air leakage matters more in extreme climates. A tiny gap that might be insignificant in mild weather becomes a serious problem when it's -30°F outside. Spray foam's complete air sealing is critical for Alaska performance.

### 8. Frequently Asked Questions (350-400 words)

**Q: How much does wall insulation cost in Alaska?**
A: New construction wall insulation runs $3.50-7.00 per square foot depending on wall depth. Retrofit projects range from $3.00-7.00 per square foot depending on method. Most whole-home projects run $5,000-15,000.

**Q: Can you insulate existing walls without removing drywall?**
A: Yes, using injection methods. We drill small holes in drywall or exterior siding, inject foam into cavities, then patch holes. Results are good but not quite as thorough as full access installation.

**Q: Is spray foam worth it for walls?**
A: For Alaska homes, yes. The combination of high R-value, air sealing, and moisture management makes spray foam the superior wall insulation choice. The extra cost vs. fiberglass pays back quickly in energy savings.

**Q: What R-value should my walls have?**
A: Alaska energy code requires approximately R-20 for above-grade walls. We typically achieve R-24 to R-37 with spray foam, exceeding code requirements.

**Q: Will wall insulation stop my drafts?**
A: Yes. Most wall-related drafts come from air leakage, and spray foam provides complete air sealing. Even injection foam reduces air leakage significantly.

**Q: Can spray foam be applied to interior walls?**
A: Yes. Open cell spray foam is excellent for interior walls when soundproofing is a goal. It's also used for additional thermal separation in some designs.

**Q: How long does wall insulation last?**
A: Spray foam wall insulation lasts 50+ years—the lifetime of the wall assembly. No maintenance, no replacement needed.

**Q: What's the difference between wall insulation types?**
A: Closed cell provides highest R-value (R-6.5/inch), vapor barrier, and structural support. Open cell provides good R-value (R-3.7/inch), excellent soundproofing, and lower cost. Injection foam is best for retrofit where access is limited.

**Q: Do I need a vapor barrier with spray foam?**
A: Closed cell foam at 2"+ thickness IS a vapor retarder—no additional vapor barrier needed. Open cell foam is vapor permeable and may need additional vapor management depending on assembly design.
