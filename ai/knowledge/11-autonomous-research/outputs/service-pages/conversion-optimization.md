## Conversion Psychology

### Understanding the Visitor Journey

**Stage 1: Awareness**
Visitor recognizes they have a problem (cold house, high bills, ice dams).
- **Page role:** Validate the problem, introduce solution
- **Key elements:** Hero section, problem statement, benefits preview

**Stage 2: Consideration**
Visitor evaluates options and providers.
- **Page role:** Establish expertise, differentiate from competitors
- **Key elements:** Process section, case studies, testimonials, FAQ

**Stage 3: Decision**
Visitor ready to take action.
- **Page role:** Remove friction, create urgency, facilitate contact
- **Key elements:** CTAs, contact forms, trust signals, guarantees

### Key Psychological Triggers

**1. Social Proof**
People follow what others do.
- Customer testimonials
- Number of homes served
- Reviews and ratings
- Case studies

**2. Authority**
Expert credentials build trust.
- Certifications (SPFA, BPI, EPA)
- Years of experience
- Technical knowledge display
- Professional imagery

**3. Scarcity/Urgency**
Limited availability motivates action.
- Seasonal messaging ("Before winter...")
- Schedule filling up
- Rebate deadlines
- Limited-time offers

**4. Loss Aversion**
Fear of loss motivates more than potential gain.
- Energy dollars "escaping"
- Damage prevention
- Comfort being stolen
- Ice dam damage risk

**5. Reciprocity**
Free value creates obligation.
- Free estimates
- Free assessments
- Free educational content
- No-obligation consultations

## CTA Strategy

### Primary CTAs

**Placement:** Hero section, bottom of page
**Purpose:** Drive main conversion action
**Design:** High-contrast button, prominent placement

**Recommended Text:**
- "Get Free Estimate" (most effective)
- "Schedule Free Assessment"
- "Request Your Quote"
- "Get Started Today"

**Button Design:**
- High contrast color (stands out from page)
- Generous padding (easy to click)
- Clear, action-oriented text
- Hover state indication

### Secondary CTAs

**Placement:** Throughout page (3-4 additional locations)
**Purpose:** Capture visitors at different stages
**Design:** Less prominent but still visible

**Recommended Text:**
- "Call (907) 310-3000"
- "Learn More"
- "See Our Work"
- "Compare Options"
