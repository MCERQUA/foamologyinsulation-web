## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (200-250 words)

**Opening Hook:**
What if you could see exactly where your money is escaping through your walls? Thermal imaging makes the invisible visible. While you feel cold drafts and notice high heating bills, thermal inspection shows you precisely where the problems are—no guessing, no assumptions, just definitive answers.

**Problem Statement:**
Most homeowners know their homes have energy problems but can't pinpoint them. Which walls are under-insulated? Where are the air leaks? Is the attic insulation doing its job? Without answers to these questions, improvements become guesswork.

**Solution Introduction:**
Professional thermal inspection uses infrared imaging technology to detect temperature differences across building surfaces. Heat loss, air infiltration, moisture intrusion, and insulation deficiencies all create distinctive thermal patterns that our cameras capture and our trained thermographers interpret.

**Why Foamology:**
As insulation specialists, we understand building thermal performance intimately. We don't just take pictures—we interpret findings in the context of Alaska building science and provide actionable recommendations.

**Page Preview:**
Learn how thermal imaging works, what it can (and can't) detect, our inspection process, and how thermal inspections inform effective insulation improvements.

### 2. How Thermal Imaging Works (300-350 words)

**The Technology:**
Infrared thermal cameras detect electromagnetic radiation in the infrared spectrum—heat energy emitted by all objects above absolute zero. The camera converts these heat patterns into visible images, with different colors representing different temperatures.

**What We See:**
Thermal images reveal:

**Temperature Gradients:**
Areas where surfaces transition from warm to cold indicate heat loss or thermal bridging.

**Air Movement Patterns:**
Air leakage creates distinctive thermal signatures as moving air changes surface temperatures.

**Moisture Presence:**
Wet materials have different thermal properties than dry materials, revealing moisture intrusion.

**Insulation Performance:**
Missing, damaged, or inadequate insulation appears as warmer areas on exterior surfaces (heat escaping) or cooler areas on interior surfaces.

**Conditions for Effective Imaging:**
Thermal imaging works best when:
- Significant temperature differential exists (Alaska winters are ideal)
- HVAC system has been running (to create thermal load)
- Weather is stable (not rapidly changing)
- Time allows for thermal equilibrium

Alaska's climate provides excellent thermal imaging conditions—the larger the indoor-outdoor temperature difference, the more clearly problems show.

**Equipment:**
We use professional-grade thermal imaging equipment with:
- High resolution sensors for detailed images
- Temperature measurement accuracy ±2°F
- Multiple color palettes for different analyses
- Image storage and reporting capabilities

**Interpretation:**
Raw thermal images require expert interpretation. Temperature patterns must be understood in context:
- Building construction type
- Expected thermal performance
- Weather conditions
- HVAC operation
- Time of day

Our trained thermographers interpret findings accurately.

### 3. What Thermal Inspections Reveal (350-400 words)

**Insulation Problems:**

**Missing Insulation:**
Completely uninsulated areas show dramatically different temperatures than insulated areas. Common locations: forgotten wall sections, above knee walls, around ductwork.

**Insufficient Insulation:**
Thin or inadequate insulation shows as warmer exterior surfaces (winter) or cooler interior surfaces. The temperature difference indicates severity.

**Settled/Displaced Insulation:**
Blown insulation that has settled or batt insulation that has sagged creates distinctive patterns—warm/cool bands rather than uniform surfaces.

**Moisture-Damaged Insulation:**
Wet insulation loses R-value dramatically. Thermal imaging reveals moisture-affected areas as temperature anomalies.

**Air Leakage:**

**Penetration Leaks:**
Electrical outlets, plumbing penetrations, recessed lights, and other penetrations show temperature variations indicating air movement.

**Structural Leaks:**
Gaps at window frames, door frames, rim joists, and wall connections appear as temperature lines or patterns.

**Ductwork Leaks:**
Leaking ductwork in unconditioned spaces creates thermal signatures at ceiling/wall junctions.

**Moisture Intrusion:**

**Roof Leaks:**
Water infiltration appears as cool spots on ceiling surfaces or walls below roof areas.

**Wall Moisture:**
Moisture in walls from condensation, plumbing leaks, or exterior intrusion creates temperature anomalies.

**Foundation Moisture:**
Basement or crawl space moisture issues show distinctive thermal patterns.

**Structural Issues:**

**Thermal Bridging:**
Heat conducting through framing, fasteners, or other structural elements appears as linear warm patterns on exterior surfaces.

**Building Envelope Integrity:**
Overall thermal envelope performance becomes visible—identifying which building components perform well and which need attention.

**What Thermal Imaging Does NOT Detect:**
- Absolute R-values (comparison only)
- Exact air leakage rates (blower door needed)
- Issues hidden deep within assemblies
- Problems without temperature signature
- Future failures (current conditions only)
