## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (250-300 words)

**Opening Hook:**
Every Alaska winter, ice dams cause thousands of dollars in damage to homes—water infiltrating ceilings, ruined insulation, mold growth, and deteriorating roof structures. Homeowners fight back with roof rakes, heat cables, and ice removal services, but the dams keep returning. That's because these approaches treat symptoms, not the cause.

**Problem Statement:**
Ice dams form because heat escapes from your home through the attic, warming the roof and melting snow. The meltwater runs down to cold eaves and refreezes, building the dam that causes water backup and damage. As long as heat keeps escaping, ice dams keep forming.

**Solution Introduction:**
True ice dam prevention addresses the heat loss that causes them. Professional attic insulation and air sealing keeps heat in your home and off your roof. When the roof stays uniformly cold, snow doesn't melt prematurely, and ice dams don't form.

**Why Foamology:**
We've solved ice dam problems for hundreds of Alaska homes. We understand the building science behind ice dams and apply proven solutions that stop them permanently. No more roof raking, no more heat cables, no more water damage.

**Page Preview:**
Learn exactly how ice dams form, why traditional remedies fail, how proper insulation solves the problem, and what our ice dam prevention process involves.

### 2. Understanding Ice Dams (400-450 words)

**How Ice Dams Form:**

**Step 1: Heat Escapes Through Attic**
Warm air from your heated home rises and escapes through the attic. This heat warms the roof deck from below.

**Step 2: Snow Melts on Warm Roof**
The warmed roof surface melts snow, even when outdoor temperatures are below freezing. Water runs down the roof.

**Step 3: Water Reaches Cold Eaves**
The roof eaves (overhang beyond exterior walls) have no heat below them—they stay cold. When meltwater reaches this cold zone, it refreezes.

**Step 4: Ice Dam Builds**
Ice accumulates at the eaves, creating a dam. More water backs up behind the dam.

**Step 5: Water Infiltrates**
Backed-up water finds its way under shingles, through roof sheathing, into your home. Damage results.

**The Temperature Differential:**
Ice dams require one specific condition: part of the roof must be above freezing (melting snow) while another part is below freezing (refreezing water). Heat escape from the attic creates this differential.

**Common Conditions:**
- Light-moderate snowfall (not too much, not too little)
- Outdoor temps 15-30°F (cold enough to refreeze, not so cold that roof never warms)
- Attic temps above freezing from heat leakage
- Multiple days of these conditions

**Damage Potential:**

| Damage Type | Cost Range |
|-------------|------------|
| Water-damaged ceiling | $500 - $3,000 |
| Wet insulation replacement | $1,000 - $4,000 |
| Mold remediation | $2,000 - $10,000 |
| Structural rot repair | $3,000 - $15,000 |
| Complete roof replacement | $15,000 - $40,000 |

A single bad ice dam event can cause $5,000-20,000 in damage. Recurring dams multiply costs over years.

**Why Some Homes Get Ice Dams:**
- Inadequate attic insulation
- Air leakage into attic (penetrations, bypasses)
- Complex roof geometry (valleys, dormers)
- Cathedral ceilings without proper insulation
- HVAC equipment in attic adding heat

**Why Some Homes Don't:**
- Well-insulated, well-sealed attic
- Uniform cold roof surface
- No significant heat escape pathways

---

### 3. Why Traditional Remedies Fail (300-350 words)

**Heat Cables:**

**What They Do:**
Electric heating cables melt channels through ice dams, allowing water to drain.

**Why They Fail:**
- Don't prevent ice dams—just try to manage them
- High electricity costs ($50-150/month running)
- Often can't keep up with severe conditions
- Create freeze/thaw cycles that stress roofing
- Must be reinstalled/maintained regularly

**Roof Raking:**

**What It Does:**
Pulling snow off lower roof sections before it can melt and refreeze.

**Why It Fails:**
- Labor-intensive (every snowfall)
- Only prevents some ice dam formation
- Doesn't address underlying heat loss
- Can damage shingles if done improperly
- Doesn't help upper roof areas

**Ice Dam Removal Services:**

**What They Do:**
Steam or mechanical removal of existing ice dams.

**Why They Fail:**
- Emergency response, not prevention
- Dams reform immediately
- Risk of roof damage during removal
- Expensive ($300-800+ per visit)
- Doesn't stop water already in home

**Additional Ventilation:**

**What It Does:**
Adding roof vents to flush warm attic air.

**Why It Fails:**
- Works against heating efficiency (venting paid-for heat)
- Can't keep up with significant heat leakage
- May increase air leakage issues
- Only partial solution at best

**Ice and Water Shield:**

**What It Does:**
Waterproof membrane under shingles at eaves.

**Why It Fails:**
- Doesn't prevent ice dams—just manages water
- Water can still back up beyond shield
- Expensive (requires roof replacement to install)
- Treats symptom, not cause

**The Common Thread:**
All these approaches assume ice dams are inevitable and try to manage consequences. They ignore the fundamental cause: heat escaping through your roof. Addressing heat loss stops ice dams from forming in the first place.

### 4. The Real Solution: Insulation & Air Sealing (400-450 words)

**The Building Science:**
Keep heat in your home and off your roof. When the roof stays cold (same temperature as outdoor air), snow doesn't melt until weather warms. No melting = no refreezing = no ice dams.

**Two-Part Solution:**

**Part 1: Insulation**
Adequate insulation slows heat transfer from warm ceilings to cold attic:
- Minimum R-49 recommended for Alaska attics
- Continuous coverage without gaps
- Addresses thermal bridging at framing

**Part 2: Air Sealing**
Air sealing stops warm air from bypassing insulation:
- Seal all penetrations (wiring, plumbing, ducts)
- Address recessed lights
- Seal attic access hatch
- Block balloon framing and chases

**Why Both Are Essential:**

Insulation alone isn't enough if air leaks carry heat around it.
Air sealing alone isn't enough if heat conducts through thin insulation.
Both together create effective thermal barrier.

**Approach Options:**

**Option A: Roof Deck Spray Foam (Best for Ice Dams)**

Apply closed cell spray foam directly to roof deck underside:
- Creates unvented "hot roof" assembly
- Heat blocked at roof plane—most direct solution
- Insulation and air barrier in single application
- Best ice dam prevention approach
- Creates conditioned attic space

**Option B: Attic Floor Spray Foam**

Apply spray foam to attic floor:
- Keeps attic unconditioned (cold)
- Stops heat from entering attic
- Must address all penetrations thoroughly
- Good ice dam prevention if done comprehensively
- Lower cost than roof deck approach

**Option C: Targeted Improvement**

Address specific problem areas:
- Focus on worst heat loss points
- Seal major air leaks
- Add insulation where thin
- May significantly reduce (not eliminate) ice dams

**Our Recommendation:**
For persistent ice dam problems, **roof deck spray foam** provides the most reliable solution. The foam is applied directly where heat escapes to the roof—maximum effectiveness at the critical point.

For moderate ice dam issues or budget constraints, **comprehensive attic floor insulation and air sealing** can substantially reduce or eliminate ice dams.

### 7. Frequently Asked Questions (350-400 words)

**Q: Will spray foam really stop ice dams?**
A: Yes. By eliminating heat escape through the roof, spray foam addresses the root cause of ice dams. Homeowners consistently report complete elimination or dramatic reduction of ice dams after proper installation.

**Q: How much does ice dam prevention cost?**
A: Comprehensive ice dam prevention through spray foam insulation typically costs $4,000-12,000 depending on attic size and approach. This one-time investment provides permanent protection plus ongoing energy savings.

**Q: Is roof deck or attic floor insulation better for ice dams?**
A: Roof deck spray foam provides the most direct and reliable ice dam prevention—stopping heat right at the roof surface. Attic floor insulation is effective if done comprehensively with thorough air sealing.

**Q: I already have insulation—why do I still get ice dams?**
A: Most ice dam problems stem from air leakage, not just insufficient insulation. Warm air bypassing insulation through penetrations, chases, and gaps is often the primary culprit. Air sealing is critical.

**Q: Can I do ice dam prevention myself?**
A: DIY air sealing (caulking, weatherstripping) can help. However, effective ice dam prevention requires comprehensive approach with professional equipment. Incomplete DIY attempts often miss critical areas.

**Q: How long does the installation take?**
A: Most attic insulation projects for ice dam prevention complete in 1-2 days.

**Q: When is the best time to do ice dam prevention?**
A: Any time, but ideally before winter. Fall is popular, but we work year-round. Don't wait until you have an active ice dam problem—address it before next winter.

**Q: Will this work on my complex roof?**
A: Yes. Complex roofs with valleys, dormers, and multiple levels often have more ice dam problems but respond well to proper insulation. We assess your specific roof geometry.

**Q: What about my existing heat cables?**
A: After proper insulation, heat cables are typically unnecessary. You can remove them or leave them as backup (they just won't need to run).

**Q: Do you guarantee ice dam elimination?**
A: We guarantee our work quality. While building conditions vary, proper insulation and air sealing dramatically reduces or eliminates ice dams for virtually all homes.
