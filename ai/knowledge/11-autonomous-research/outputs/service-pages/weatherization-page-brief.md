## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (200-250 words)

**Opening Hook:**
Weatherization isn't a single improvement—it's a comprehensive approach to making your home comfortable and efficient in Alaska's demanding climate. Rather than addressing one problem at a time, weatherization evaluates your entire home and implements a coordinated set of improvements that work together.

**Problem Statement:**
Many homeowners make piecemeal improvements: add insulation here, seal a window there. But without a systematic approach, improvements may miss critical areas, conflict with each other, or fail to address the biggest energy wasters.

**Solution Introduction:**
Professional weatherization services start with comprehensive assessment, prioritize improvements based on energy impact, and implement solutions that complement each other. The result is a comfortable, efficient home with dramatically reduced heating costs.

**Why Foamology:**
We specialize in the insulation and air sealing components that form the core of effective weatherization. Our work integrates with other weatherization measures to deliver maximum improvement.

### 2. What is Weatherization? (300-350 words)

**Definition:**
Weatherization is the practice of protecting a building from weather elements—primarily heat loss in cold climates like Alaska. It encompasses improvements to insulation, air sealing, windows, doors, and related systems to reduce energy consumption and improve comfort.

**Core Components:**

**Insulation:**
- Attic insulation
- Wall insulation
- Crawl space/floor insulation
- Rim joist insulation

**Air Sealing:**
- Penetration sealing
- Duct sealing
- Window/door weatherstripping
- Bypass elimination

**Building Envelope:**
- Window upgrades/repairs
- Door sealing
- Foundation sealing
- Ventilation optimization

**Related Improvements:**
- Heating system optimization
- Duct insulation and sealing
- Moisture management
- Combustion safety testing

**Why Comprehensive Matters:**
Individual improvements provide limited benefit if other major problems remain. Example: Adding attic insulation while ignoring major air leaks may provide only 30% of potential savings. Adding air sealing to the same project could achieve 80%+ of potential.

**Weatherization vs. Single Improvements:**

| Approach | Typical Savings |
|----------|-----------------|
| Attic insulation only | 15-25% |
| Air sealing only | 10-20% |
| Attic insulation + air sealing | 35-50% |
| Comprehensive weatherization | 40-60% |

The synergy between improvements multiplies benefits.

**Alaska-Specific Weatherization:**
Alaska's extreme climate means weatherization investments pay back faster than anywhere in the continental U.S. The same improvements that save $500/year in a mild climate save $1,500-2,500/year in Alaska.
