## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (200-250 words)

**Opening Hook:**
Your home may be decades old, but it doesn't have to perform like it. Retrofit insulation brings modern energy efficiency to existing homes—without tearing them down and starting over. The result: dramatically improved comfort, significantly lower heating bills, and a home that performs like it was built today.

**Problem Statement:**
Most Alaska homes built before 2000 have inadequate insulation by today's standards. Many have original fiberglass batts that have settled, compressed, or simply weren't sufficient from day one. These homes leak heat, create uncomfortable rooms, and cost far more to heat than necessary.

**Solution Introduction:**
Retrofit insulation upgrades your existing home strategically. We access attics, crawl spaces, and wall cavities to add spray foam insulation where it matters most. The improvements transform your home's performance without major renovation.

**Why Foamology:**
We specialize in retrofit solutions. We understand how to work within existing structures, how to access difficult spaces, and how to maximize improvement with minimal disruption to your home and life.

### 2. Retrofit Opportunities (350-400 words)

**Attic Insulation:**

The most accessible and highest-impact retrofit opportunity:

**Attic Floor Approach:**
- Access through attic hatch
- Remove or supplement existing insulation
- Apply spray foam to attic floor
- Air seal all penetrations
- Minimal home disruption

**Roof Deck Approach:**
- Access through attic
- Apply spray foam to roof deck underside
- Creates conditioned attic
- Best for ice dam prevention
- Protects HVAC in attic

**Results:**
- 20-40% heating cost reduction (attic alone)
- Ice dam elimination/reduction
- Comfortable upper floors
- Even temperatures

**Crawl Space:**

Second most accessible retrofit opportunity:

**Wall Encapsulation:**
- Access through crawl space entry
- Apply spray foam to perimeter walls
- Install vapor barrier on floor
- Seal rim joist areas
- Create conditioned crawl space

**Results:**
- Eliminate cold floors
- Prevent frozen pipes
- Stop moisture/mold problems
- 15-25% additional savings

**Rim Joist Areas:**

Often overlooked but highly impactful:

- Access from basement or crawl space
- Apply spray foam to all rim joist areas
- Major air sealing benefit
- Relatively low cost, high impact

**Wall Insulation:**

More challenging but achievable:

**Drill-and-Inject:**
- Drill access holes in drywall or exterior
- Inject foam into wall cavities
- Patch access holes
- Less disruptive than drywall removal

**Drywall Removal:**
- Remove drywall on one side
- Full access to cavity
- Direct spray foam application
- Replace drywall
- Best results, more disruptive

**Practical Assessment:**
Wall retrofit is more complex and expensive than attic/crawl space. We assess whether wall work is cost-effective for your situation.

### 3. Retrofit vs. New Construction (250-300 words)

**Key Differences:**

**Access:**
- New construction: Open cavities, easy access
- Retrofit: Must work within existing structure

**Scope:**
- New construction: Complete coverage routine
- Retrofit: Strategic improvement based on access

**Disruption:**
- New construction: No occupants affected
- Retrofit: Must work around residents

**Cost:**
- New construction: Efficient bulk application
- Retrofit: Higher per-square-foot cost due to access challenges

**Results:**
- New construction: 100% of potential achieved
- Retrofit: 70-90% of potential typically achievable

**Realistic Expectations:**

Retrofit insulation dramatically improves older homes but may not match new construction performance exactly. Access limitations, existing conditions, and practical constraints affect results.

**What Retrofit Typically Achieves:**
- Attic retrofit: 80-100% of new construction performance
- Crawl space retrofit: 80-95% of new construction performance
- Wall retrofit (drill-inject): 60-80% of new construction performance
- Wall retrofit (drywall removal): 85-95% of new construction performance

**The Value Proposition:**
Retrofit delivers most of the improvement at a fraction of the cost of building new. A $15,000 retrofit investment can transform a 1980s home into a comfortable, efficient residence—compared to $500,000+ to build new.

### 4. Our Retrofit Process (300-350 words)

**Step 1: Comprehensive Assessment**

We evaluate your entire home:
- Current insulation levels and condition
- Air leakage identification
- Access points and feasibility
- Priority areas for improvement
- Budget and goals discussion

**Step 2: Custom Retrofit Plan**

Based on assessment:
- Prioritized improvement list
- Access approach for each area
- Expected results
- Timeline and disruption assessment
- Detailed pricing

**Step 3: Work Sequencing**

We typically recommend:
1. Air sealing (while accessing spaces)
2. Attic insulation (highest impact)
3. Crawl space insulation (second priority)
4. Rim joists (included with above)
5. Walls (if feasible and worthwhile)

**Step 4: Professional Installation**

Our crews work carefully in existing homes:
- Protection of floors and belongings
- Clean and professional work habits
- Respectful of occupied space
- Daily cleanup

**Step 5: Verification**

After completion:
- Visual inspection
- Thermal imaging (when conditions allow)
- Discussion of results
- Maintenance guidance

**Typical Timeline:**

| Project | Duration |
|---------|----------|
| Attic only | 1 day |
| Crawl space only | 1 day |
| Attic + crawl space | 1-2 days |
| Add rim joists | Included in above |
| Wall retrofit (inject) | 2-3 days |
| Comprehensive retrofit | 3-5 days |

### 6. Frequently Asked Questions (250-300 words)

**Q: Is retrofit insulation worth it for older homes?**
A: Absolutely. Older homes typically have the most to gain. A 1970s home might use twice the energy of a modern home—retrofit closes most of that gap.

**Q: How disruptive is retrofit insulation?**
A: Attic and crawl space work causes minimal disruption—we work in spaces you don't use daily. Wall work is more disruptive but still manageable.

**Q: Can you insulate my walls without removing drywall?**
A: Often yes, using drill-and-inject methods. Results aren't quite as thorough as full access, but significant improvement is achievable.

**Q: What if my attic already has insulation?**
A: We can often add spray foam over or around existing insulation, or remove and replace depending on conditions.

**Q: How much will I save on heating?**
A: Typical retrofit achieves 30-50% heating cost reduction. Results depend on current conditions and scope of work.

**Q: Do I need to leave my home during retrofit?**
A: Usually not. For attic and crawl space work, you can remain in the home. For spray areas specifically, 24-hour avoidance is recommended.

**Q: Will retrofit help with ice dams?**
A: Yes, if attic is included. Proper attic insulation is key to ice dam prevention.

**Q: How long does retrofit last?**
A: Spray foam lasts 50+ years. It's a permanent improvement, not something you'll need to redo.
