## Page Outline

### 1. Introduction (200-250 words)

**Opening Hook:**
Most homeowners know their home has energy problems—but few know exactly where the problems are or which improvements will deliver the best return. A professional energy audit answers these questions definitively, turning guesswork into informed decisions.

**Problem Statement:**
Without data, energy improvements become educated guesses. You might add attic insulation when air sealing would help more. You might replace windows when the real problem is in the crawl space. Random improvements waste money and miss opportunities.

**Solution Introduction:**
A professional energy audit uses diagnostic equipment and trained analysis to evaluate your entire home. Thermal imaging reveals heat loss patterns. Blower door testing quantifies air leakage. Comprehensive inspection identifies insulation deficiencies, safety issues, and improvement opportunities.

**Why Foamology:**
As insulation specialists, we understand what drives energy loss and what improvements deliver results. Our audits provide actionable recommendations prioritized by impact—and we can implement the insulation improvements identified.

### 2. What's Included in an Energy Audit (350-400 words)

**Thermal Imaging:**

Infrared cameras reveal temperature patterns across building surfaces:
- Heat loss through walls, ceilings, floors
- Air leakage pathways
- Missing or damaged insulation
- Moisture issues

Thermal imaging shows where problems are located, guiding improvement priorities.

**Blower Door Testing:**

The blower door is a calibrated fan that depressurizes your home, measuring total air leakage:
- Quantifies air leakage rate (CFM or ACH50)
- Allows comparison to standards
- Identifies leaky areas with thermal imaging
- Measures improvement after work

**Results provide:**
- Baseline air leakage measurement
- Comparison to code and efficiency targets

### 4. Understanding Your Results (250-300 words)

**Blower Door Results:**

Air leakage measured in CFM50 (cubic feet per minute at 50 pascals pressure) or ACH50 (air changes per hour at 50 pascals).

**What the Numbers Mean:**

| ACH50 | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 10+ | Very leaky | Significant air sealing needed |
| 7-10 | Leaky | Common in older homes |
| 5-7 | Average | Moderate improvement opportunity |
| 3-5 | Good | Modern code-built home |
| 1-3 | Tight | High-performance home |

**Thermal Imaging Results:**

Color images show temperature patterns:
- **Bright/warm colors**: Heat escaping or warm surfaces
- **Dark/cool colors**: Cold areas or infiltration
- **Patterns**: Indicate specific problems (missing insulation, air leakage, moisture)

**Priority Rankings:**

We prioritize improvements by:
1. **Safety issues**: Must be addressed
2. **Highest energy impact**: Most savings per dollar spent
3. **Comfort improvement**: Quality of life benefits
4. **Code compliance**: Meeting minimum standards

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

For each improvement, we estimate:
- Implementation cost
- Annual energy savings
- Payback period
- Rebate potential

This allows informed decision-making about which improvements to pursue.

### 5. AHFC Energy Rating Integration (250-300 words)

**Home Energy Rebate Program:**

Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) offers rebates for energy improvements. The program works as follows:

**Step 1: "As Is" Rating**
Certified energy rater assesses home's current energy performance, providing a rating.

**Step 2: Improvements**
Complete qualifying energy improvements (insulation, air sealing, etc.).

**Step 3: "Post-Improvement" Rating**
Same energy rater assesses improved home.

**Step 4: Rebate**
Based on improvement achieved, receive rebate up to $10,000.

**Our Role:**

We provide:
- Comprehensive audit that may satisfy "As Is" assessment
- Or coordinate with certified energy rater
- Implement qualifying improvements
- Documentation for post-improvement rating

**Important Note:**
For official AHFC rebates, ratings must be done by certified energy rater. We can coordinate this process or provide audits that support but don't replace the official rating.

**Why Audit Before AHFC Rating:**

Our audit may identify:
- Issues that affect what improvements to pursue
- Problems the rating might not catch
- Air sealing opportunities often overlooked
- Strategic improvement sequencing
