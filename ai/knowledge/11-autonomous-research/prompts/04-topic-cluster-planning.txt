AUTONOMOUS TASK: Topic Cluster and Pillar Content Strategy

OBJECTIVE: Design a comprehensive topic cluster architecture for maximum SEO impact and user value.

PREREQUISITES:
- Read all keyword research files from /home/josh/Josh-AI/websites/foamologyinsulation-web/ai/knowledge/11-autonomous-research/keywords/
- Read content gap analysis from /home/josh/Josh-AI/websites/foamologyinsulation-web/ai/knowledge/11-autonomous-research/content-gaps/
- Understand current website structure

RESEARCH SCOPE:
Create a hub-and-spoke topic cluster model where:
- Pillar pages cover broad topics (spray foam insulation topics)
- Cluster pages cover specific subtopics and link back to pillars
- Internal linking strategy connects everything logically

DELIVERABLES:
Create the following files in /home/josh/Josh-AI/websites/foamologyinsulation-web/ai/knowledge/11-autonomous-research/topic-clusters/:

1. pillar-pages-overview.md - List and description of 8-12 main pillar pages
2. cluster-architecture.md - Visual representation (text-based) of topic clusters
3. cluster-01-[topic].md - Complete cluster: primary services/topics
4. cluster-02-[topic].md - Maintenance, repairs, prevention
5. cluster-03-[topic].md - Certifications, warranties, quality
6. cluster-04-[topic].md - Location services ({{CITY_LIST}})
7. cluster-05-[topic].md - Emergency services, storm damage
8. cluster-06-[topic].md - Buyer guides, cost guides, ROI, comparisons
9. cluster-07-[topic].md - Industry education, terminology, best practices
10. cluster-08-[topic].md - Company expertise, certifications, process
11. internal-linking-strategy.md - How pages link together, anchor text suggestions
12. topic-cluster-map.csv - CSV: cluster_name, pillar_page, cluster_pages, target_keywords

TOPIC CLUSTER STRUCTURE:
For each cluster, define:
1. Pillar Page Title and URL
2. Target Keywords (3-5 primary)
3. Content Brief (what it covers)
4. 8-15 Cluster Pages with:
   - Page title
   - Target keyword
   - Content angle
   - Word count target
   - Priority (high/medium/low)
5. Internal Linking Map
6. External Authority Sources

EXAMPLE CLUSTER FORMAT:

## Cluster: [Main Topic]

**Pillar Page:** "[Title for Anchorage, Mat-Su Valley, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Wasilla, Palmer, Eagle River, Soldotna, Homer, Seward, Fairbanks Businesses]"
**URL:** /[topic]/
**Keywords:** [primary keywords related to spray foam insulation]

**Cluster Pages:**
1. "[Specific Service/Topic]: [Benefits & Details]"
   - Keyword: [specific keyword]
   - Angle: Complete guide to [topic]
   - Links: Back to pillar, to related pages
   - Priority: High

2. "[Related Topic]: [Unique Angle]"
   [etc...]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Detailed markdown for each cluster
- Clear hierarchy and relationships
- Include keyword mapping
- Specify internal linking structure
- Note content dependencies (what needs to be written first)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Minimum 8 comprehensive topic clusters
- Each pillar should have 8-15 cluster pages
- Total of 80-120 content pieces mapped
- Clear SEO strategy for each piece
- Logical content progression for users
- Consider buyer journey stages

Think like an SEO expert and content strategist. Build clusters that will dominate search results.
