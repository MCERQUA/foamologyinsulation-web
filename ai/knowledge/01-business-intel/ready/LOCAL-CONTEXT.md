# Foamology Insulation - Local Context Reference

**CRITICAL: This file MUST be referenced during all content generation**

This document ensures all articles, blogs, and content are properly localized for Foamology's Alaska market.

## Target Market

### Primary Service Area
- **Anchorage** (primary)
- **Mat-Su Valley** (Wasilla, Palmer)
- **Eagle River / Chugiak**
- **Kenai Peninsula**

### State
- **Alaska** (NOT Arizona, NOT Alabama, NOT Arkansas)
- State Code: **AK**
- Area Code: **907**

## Climate Zone

### Alaska is Climate Zone 7-8

Alaska has the **HIGHEST insulation requirements** in the United States.

| Zone | Areas | Characteristics |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Zone 7 | Anchorage, Mat-Su, Kenai | Extreme cold, long winters |
| Zone 8 | Fairbanks, Interior Alaska | Subarctic, permafrost |

### Comparison to Lower 48 States

When writing content, **always include Alaska-specific context**:

| Factor | Alaska (Zone 7-8) | Arizona (Zone 2-4) | Continental US Average |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Heating Degree Days | 10,000-14,000 | 1,000-3,000 | 4,000-6,000 |
| Winter Low Temps | -20°F to -40°F | 30°F to 50°F | 10°F to 30°F |
| Heating Season | 8-9 months | 2-3 months | 5-6 months |
| Primary Concern | Heat retention | Cooling | Mixed |
| R-Value Attic | R-49+ (code) | R-30 (code) | R-38 |
| R-Value Walls | R-20+ (code) | R-13 (code) | R-15 |
| R-Value Floor | R-38 (code) | R-13 (code) | R-19 |

### Unique Alaska Challenges

**ALWAYS mention these in relevant articles:**

1. **Ice Dams** - Major problem in Alaska due to temperature differentials
2. **Permafrost** - Foundation concerns in interior/northern areas
3. **Extreme Cold Starts** - Vehicles and homes take longer to warm
4. **Moisture from Snow** - Snow melt and humidity management
5. **Long Dark Winters** - Energy costs are critical 8+ months/year
6. **Stack Effect** - Extreme temperature differences amplify air movement
7. **Fuel Oil Heating** - Many homes use oil, making efficiency crucial
8. **High Energy Costs** - Electricity and heating fuel cost more in AK

## Alaska-Specific Rebates & Programs

**USE THESE - NOT Arizona programs:**

### Federal Programs (Apply Everywhere)
- **25C Tax Credit**: 30% of insulation materials, up to $1,200/year (through 2032)
- **Inflation Reduction Act**: Various home energy credits

### Alaska State Programs
- **Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC)**
  - Home Energy Rebate Program
  - Weatherization Assistance Program
  - Energy Efficiency Interest Rate Reduction
  - Website: ahfc.us

- **Alaska Energy Authority (AEA)**
  - Village Energy Efficiency Program
  - Renewable Energy Fund

### Utility Rebates
- **Chugach Electric Association** (Anchorage area)
  - Home Energy Rebate programs
  - Energy audits

- **Matanuska Electric Association (MEA)** (Mat-Su Valley)
  - Energy efficiency rebates

- **Golden Valley Electric (GVEA)** (Fairbanks)
  - Home energy programs

### Typical Alaska Rebate Amounts
- AHFC Rebate: Up to **$10,000** for comprehensive weatherization
- Energy Audit: Often **free or subsidized** through utilities
- Combined Savings: **$5,000 - $15,000** possible on major projects

## Content Localization Requirements

### Every Article MUST Include:

1. **Alaska-specific climate context**
   - Mention Zone 7-8 requirements
   - Reference extreme temperatures
   - Discuss long heating seasons

2. **Local comparisons**
   - Compare to "warmer climates" or "the lower 48"
   - Explain why Alaska needs more insulation
   - Highlight unique challenges (ice dams, permafrost)

3. **Correct rebate information**
   - AHFC programs (NOT Arizona programs)
   - Local utility rebates
   - Federal tax credits

4. **Local city references**
   - Mention Anchorage, Wasilla, Palmer, Eagle River
   - Use Alaska area code (907)
   - Reference local weather patterns

### Red Flags to Check For

**REJECT content that mentions:**
- Arizona, Phoenix, Tucson (wrong state)
- APS (Arizona Public Service)
- SRP (Salt River Project)
- "Desert climate" or "cooling costs"
- Zone 2-4 requirements (too warm)
- Low R-value recommendations (<R-20 walls)

**REQUIRE content that mentions:**
- Alaska, Anchorage, Mat-Su
- AHFC, AEA, Chugach Electric
- "Extreme cold" or "subarctic"
- Zone 7-8 requirements
- High R-value recommendations (R-49+ attic)

## Sample Comparison Language

Use language like this in articles:

> "Unlike homes in warmer states like Arizona or Texas, Alaska homes face extreme challenges. While an Arizona home might get by with R-30 attic insulation, Alaska building codes require R-49 or higher—and many experts recommend exceeding code for maximum savings."

> "In Anchorage, winter temperatures regularly drop below zero, making proper insulation not just a comfort issue but a survival necessity. Your crawl space isn't dealing with Phoenix's 100°F summers—it's fighting -20°F winters."

> "Alaska homeowners can save significantly more than the national average on energy costs because our heating seasons last 8-9 months versus 5-6 months in the continental US."

## Quality Control Checklist

Before publishing ANY content, verify:

- [ ] No mentions of Arizona, Texas, Florida, or other warm states as "our area"
- [ ] All rebate programs are Alaska-specific (AHFC, AEA, local utilities)
- [ ] R-value recommendations match Zone 7-8 (R-49 attic, R-20+ walls)
- [ ] Content addresses ice dams, extreme cold, long winters
- [ ] Local cities mentioned (Anchorage, Wasilla, Palmer, Eagle River)
- [ ] Phone number uses 907 area code
- [ ] Comparisons to "lower 48" or "warmer climates" are used appropriately
