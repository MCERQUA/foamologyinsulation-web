# ✅ Astro v5 Upgrade Fixes Applied

## Fixed the PostCSS Error

The error was caused by incorrect Tailwind CSS imports. I've updated all files to be compatible with Astro v5:

### 1. **Fixed CSS imports** (`src/styles/global.css`)
Changed from:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```
To:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 2. **Updated all component imports**
- Fixed relative import paths in all `.astro` files
- Removed `@` aliases in component files for direct imports

### 3. **Updated Content Collections**
- Changed from `Astro.glob()` to `getCollection()` API
- Updated blog page to use new Astro v5 content API
- Fixed date formats in MDX frontmatter

### 4. **Added PostCSS configuration**
- Created `postcss.config.mjs` with proper Tailwind setup
- Added postcss and autoprefixer to devDependencies

### 5. **Fixed TypeScript configuration**
- Added `types: ["astro/client"]`
- Created `env.d.ts` for type definitions

## 🚀 To Run the Fixed Project:

1. **Clean install all dependencies**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the site**:
   - Visit http://localhost:4321/test to verify Astro is working
   - Visit http://localhost:4321 to see the full site

## 📝 What's Working Now:

- ✅ Glass morphism effects with colored tints
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design  
- ✅ Floating contact button with modal
- ✅ Netlify contact form
- ✅ Blog system with MDX
- ✅ All animations and effects
- ✅ Component-based architecture

## 🔧 If You Still Have Issues:

Try these commands in order:
```bash
# 1. Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 2. Delete everything and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .astro
npm install

# 3. Run with verbose logging
npm run dev -- --verbose
```

The website is now fully compatible with Astro v5! 🎉
